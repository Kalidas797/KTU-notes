Expectations.

Ethics in engineering is the ability as well as responsibility of
an engineer to judge his decisions from the context of the general wellbeing of the
society. It is the study of moral issues that confront engineers and engineering
organizations when some crucial decisions are taken. Engineering research and
practice requires that the task being performed considers all the pros and cons of a
certain action and its implementation. Professional engineering bodies like, IEEE,
ASME, IEI etc., have evolved comprehensive ethics codes relevant to their respective
professions, based on the rich experience of their members. Independent organizations
like NSPE have prepared value based ethical codes applicable to all engineering
professions.

WHY ENGINEERING ETHICS? (3 marks)

• The objectives of this course on ‘Professional Ethics and Human Values’ are:
• (a) to understand the moral values that ought to guide the Engineering
profession,
• b) resolve the moral issues in the profession, and
• (c) justify the moral judgment concerning the profession. It is intended to
develop a set of beliefs, attitudes, and habits that engineers should display
concerning morality.

• The prime objective is to increase one’s ability to deal
effectively with moral complexity in engineering practice

PROFESSIONAL ETHICS

• Profession is a commitment to a designated and organized occupation by virtue of
being an authority over a body of knowledge with requisite skills acquired
through specialized training.
• An occupation becomes a profession when a group of people sharing the same
occupation work together in a morally acceptable way with members setting and
following a certain ethics code.
• A professional is a practitioner belonging to a specific profession. Professional
ethics, as opposed to personal values and morality, is a set of ethical standards
and values a practicing engineer is required to follow.
It sets the standards for professional practice, and is only learned in a professional
school or while practicing one’s own profession. Today, it is an essential part of
professional education because it helps students deal with issues they will face.
 Examine the scope of professional ethics. (5 marks)
The scope of professional ethics envelopes diverse activities like
• Engineering as a social experimentation
• Engineers responsibility for safety
• Role of engineers, managers, consultants etc.
• Rights of engineers
• Moral reasoning and ethical theories
• Responsibility to employers
• Global issues and concerns

HUMAN VALUES, MORALS, & ETHICS

• For understanding of how in order for individuals, organizations and societies to
endure and function effectively, it is essential that an individual's positive
exalting forces be rediscovered and revitalized. Human values embrace the entire
range of values pertinent to the humancondition, interest, behavior, and aspiration.
• While laws are a set of rules for personal or corporate behavior and working
against such rules will attract recrimination and punishment, morals on the other
hand are a set of standards for personal behavior and ethics are a set of standards
for professional behavior. Morals and ethics are self imposed or regulated and
voluntary when broadly interpreted.
• Human values have been employed in so distinctively different ways in human
discourse. It is often said that a person has a value or an object has a value.
 Define the term value. (3 marks)
• If one wants to know the origin of the term ‘VALUE’, it may be stated very
firmly that the term ‘VALUE’ comes from the Latin word ‘VALERE’ which
means ‘to be of worth’. Whereas, the concise Oxford Dictionary defines the term
VALUE’ as the ‘worth, desirability or utilityof a thing’.
• In fact, it is difficult to define values, for they are as comprehensive in a nature as
our human life. Somewhere, some other dictionary states that Value is that which
renders anything useful, worthy or estimable. It is price, worth or importance of a
thing’.
• Value is “a concept explicit of implicit, distinctive of an individual or
characteristics of a group of those desirable traits which influence the selection
from available modes and ends of action.”
• In fact, value is an abstract term which is commonly regarded as an economic
conception. In the words of John Dewey, “Value means primarily, to price, to

Page 4 of 58

esteem, to appraise, to estimate. It means the act of cherishing something holding
it clear and also, the act of passing judgement upon the nature and amount of its
value as compared with something else,” Values are defined as something which
are desirable and worthy of esteem for their own sake. Human values are defined
as those values which help man to live in harmony with the world.
• Values that may be included in the general definition of human values are love,
brotherhood, respect for others — including plants and animals
— Honesty, sincerity, truthfulness, non-violence, gratitude, tolerance, a sense of
responsibility, cooperation, self-reliance, secularism and internationalism.
• Professional engineers possess various skills and capabilities in designing and
processing numerous products. They are equipped with technical skills to solve
and settle the problems in their careers.
• The engineers, who take up challenging administrative posts, are confronted with
various industrial problems such as worker’s unrest and wage disputes. These
problems could be amicably settled, if engineers have a strategic approach, moral
honesty and self-less commitment.
• In short, better knowledge and exposure on the various aspects of human values
would help them form a successful co-ordination and management of
administrative and labour problems. Hence, human values have become an
essential part of the successful career of the professional engineers

MORALS, VALUES & ETHICS

• Morals, values and ethics that form the vital constituents of human values enable
the professional engineers to differentiate right things from wrong things in
order to take a balanced judgment in the industrial conflicts.

 Define Morals.(3 marks)

MORALS

• Morals are the welfare principles enunciated by the wise people, based on their
experience and wisdom. They were edited, changed or modified or evolved to suit
the geography of the region, rulers (dynasty), and i n accordance with
development of knowledge in science and technology and with time.
• Morality is concerned with principles and practices of morals such as
(a) What ought or ought not to be done in a given situation?
(b) What is right or wrong about the handling of a situation? and
(c) What is good or bad about the people, policies, and ideals involved?
• Morals are the prevailing standards of behavior that enable people to live
cooperatively in groups. Moral refers to what societies sanction as right and
acceptable.
• Most people tend to act morally and follow societal guidelines. Morality often
requires that people sacrifice their own short-term interests for the benefit of
society. People or entities that are indifferent to right and wrong are considered
amoral, while those who do evil acts are considered immoral.
• While some moral principles seem to transcend time and culture, such as fairness,
generally speaking, morality is not fixed. Morality describesthe particular values
of a specific group at a specific point in time.
• Historically, morality has been closely connected to religious traditions, but today
its significance is equally important to the secular world. For example, businesses
and government agencies have codes of ethics that employees are expected to
follow.
• Some philosophers make a distinction between morals and ethics. But many
people use the terms morals and ethics interchangeably when talking about

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 6 of 58

personal beliefs, actions, or principles. For example, it’s common to say, “My
morals prevent me from cheating.” It’s also common to use ethics in this sentence
instead.
• The term morals refers to the philosophical study which focusses on
right and wrong behaviour. An exposure of an engineer to the basic
aspects of moral philosophy provides him the capability to deal with the
financial, industrial and technical formalities. The moral issues enable the
professionally - committed engineers to develop perfect familiarity with the
industrial environment. The various types of moral issues and their interactions
are given below:
 Explain the various types of moral issues? (7 marks)

The various types of moral issues and their interactions are
1. Organization Related Type: This type of moral issues comprises the professionally
employed engineers. The engineers tend to show an enthusiastic interest and
involvement for the upgraded development and growth of their concerned organizations.
This type further restricts the engineers to derive any personnel benefits in an
unauthorized way through the organization
2. Environment Related Type: This type of moral issue underlines the important

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 7 of 58

value of certain environmental factors such as land, air and water. It further emphasizes
that engineers should have the innovative capability to make use of these
natural resources without causing any environmental pollution and
depletion thereby maintaining the ecological balance.
3. Society Related Type: Social awareness and commitment of the professional
engineers is the essence of this type. The engineers who have been employed in various
organizations, are not supposed to be self - motivated and self – centered for the sake of
personnel benefits without minding the social and community welfare.
4. Product Related Type: This type of moral issue focuses on the nature andsafety of the
product and also its functional value and quality. The professional engineers are inclined to
provide top priority about the geniuses and originality of the product there by avoiding
substandard quality of the products.
5. Finance / Cost Related Type: Fixation of correct cost of any product without any
financial burden on the part of the consumers is the objective of this type of moral issue.
This type is also directly associated with the moral honesty in an ethical sense.
6. Customer Related Type: Easy availability of a specific product without any
scarcity, and its correct cost are the main aspects of this type. Black marketing and
duplicate quality of the product are the other factors that are highlighted by this type.
7. Employee Related Type: Provision of safe or protective working atmosphere,
reasonable and justified work-load norms based on the efficiency, proper remuneration
and retirement benefits to the employees of an organization are the important factors

that are mainly emphasized in this type. Fair treatment and proper care for the well-
being of the employees is also much considered in this category.

8. Competitor Related Type: This type enforces strict morality and commitment in
terms of healthy and genuine business activities on the part of the engineers. Engineers
should be restrained from indulging in any unethical activities against the competitor for
the commercial marketing of the products.He must resist to provide any false assurances

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 8 of 58

about the facts and figures of the concerned products to the suppliers or consumers.
9. Government Related Type: This type directly points out the norms and policies of
the government authorities about the manufacturing and distributing the particular
consumer products. This type clearly indicates that the professional engineers should
strictly adhere to the rules and regulations of the government in terms of regular and
prompt payment of central excise duties and taxes as per the existing norms.
Illegal transactions should be strictly prohibited by the professional engineers and all
necessary co-operations should be rendered by them to the customs and central excise
officials, if any controversial disputes arises.
 Write a short note on Values.(7 marks)
VALUES

• Humans have the unique ability to define their identity, choose their values and
establish their beliefs. All three of these directly influence a person’sbehaviour.
• Values which constitute an important component of behavioral andintellectual
status of people, contribute to the stable and justified character.
• These values enable the persons to differentiate several moral issues suchas good
from bad, favorable from unfavorable and honest from dishonest.
• In real ethical sense, the term values strictly refers to the strong beliefs that
influence the persons to take suitable remedies as a guiding force toany critical
problem.
Generally, value has been taken to mean moral ideas, general conceptions or
orientations towards the world or sometimes simply interests, attitudes,
preferences, needs, sentiments and dispositions.

• Values which constitute an important component of behavioral and intellectual status

from unfavorable and honest from dishonest.
• In real ethical sense, the term values strictly refers to the strong beliefs that influence
the persons to take suitable remedies as a guiding force to any critical problem.
• A value system is viewed as a relatively permanent perceptual frame work which
influences the nature of an individual’s behaviour. The values are the attributes
possessed by an individual and thought desirable. Values are similar to attitudes but
are more permanent and well built in nature.
• “Values are the scales we use to weigh our choices for our actions, whet her to
move towards or away from something.”
 State the importance of values. (5 marks)

IMPORTANCE OF VALUES

• Values lay the foundations for the understanding of attitudes and
motivation.
• Personal value system influences the perception of individuals.
• Value system influences the manager’s perception of the different
situations.
• Personal value system influences the way in which a manager views theother
individuals and the groups of individuals in the organization.
• Value system also influences a manager’s decisions and his solutions tothe
various problems.
• Values influence the attitudes and behaviors. An individual will get morejob
satisfaction if his values align with the organization's policies.
• If the organization's policies are different from his views and values, he
will be disappointed; the disappointment will lead to job dissatisfaction and decline
in performance.
• The challenge and reexamination of established work values constitute important
corner stones of the current management revolution all over the world. Hence, an
understanding of the values becomes a necessity.

 What are the sources of values? (9 marks)

SOURCES OF VALUES

1.Family Factor: The most important factor which influences the value system of
an individual is his immediate family. Some values are inculcated and a person learn
and develops values from the following sources the individuals from the childhood
and remain in his mind throughout his life. The child rearing practices the parents
adopt shape the personality of the human being. Family is the most influential factor
in theindividual’s learning of social behaviour, values and norms.
2. Social Factors: Out of all the social factors school plays the most important
role in developing the value system of an individual. The child learns the basic
discipline from the school.
Moreover, the interactions with the teachers, classmates and other staff members
in the schools and colleges make the child inculcate values important to the
teaching- learning process. Other social factors which may affect values are
religious economic and political institutional in thesociety.
3.Personal Factors: Personal traits such as intelligence, ability, appearance and
educational level of the person determine his development of values. For
example, if a person is highly intelligent, hewill understand the values faster. If he
is highly educated, high values will be inculcated in him by his school and
college.
4. Cultural Factors: Cultural factors include everything that is learned and
passed on from generation to generation. Culture includes certain beliefs and
other patterns of behaviour. An individual is a participant in social culture, group
culture and organisational culture. Thus, he is known as a composite of many
cultural elements.
Culture is based on certain implicit and explicit values. For example, whether a
person is co-operative, friendly or hostile depends upon to which culture he
belongs to Individual relationships are different in different cultures and within

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 11 of 58

certain groups of society also. Whether, the individual values money making or
doing service to the mankind againdepends upon his cultural background.
5.Religious Factors: Individuals, generally, receive strength and comfort from their
religion. Religion comprises of a formal set of values which arepassed on from
generation to generation. Advancement in technology has under viewed faith in
traditional religious beliefs and values.
6.Life Experiences: A man learns the most from his own personal life experience.
Sometimes man can learn from the experience of others also. Inthe long run, most of
the values which influence our behaviour are validatedby the satisfaction we have
experienced in pursuing them. Individuals work out their values on the basis of what
seems most logical to them.
 Values carry importance in direct proportion to how much faith the individual has
in them. He should have those values which can stand the test of reality. He should
not have rigid values but flexible system whichcan change with the changes in the
individual himself, his life situation and the socio-economic environment.
7. Role Demands: The role demand refers to the behaviour associated with a particular
position in the organization. All organisations have some formal and some informal code
of behaviour. Role demand can create problems when there is a role conflict. Thus, the
managers will have to quickly learn the value system prevalent in the organization. If
they want to move up the ladder of success.
 For example, if the informal code of behaviour says that the manager must mix up
socially with the subordinates, he should learn to do so even though, his personal
value system conflicts with his role as a manager.
8. Halo Effect: The halo effect refers to the tendency of judging people on the
basis of a single trait, which may be good or bad, favorable or un-favorable.
Sometimes, we judge a person by one first impression about him or her. For
example, if a person is kind, he will also be perceived as good, able, helpful,
cheerful, nice, and intelligent and so on. On the other hand, if a person is

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 12 of 58

abrasive, he shall also be perceived as bad, awful, unkind, aggressive, harmful
and wicked. Thus, what one sees in the universe depends partly on one’s inner
needs. Thus, with the help of halo effect, we see certain values in others whichare
actually not there, but we perceive them to be there.
 Explain the major types of values? (5 marks)
VALUES ARE OF TWO TYPES: TERMINAL & INSTRUMENTAL VALUES
 Terminal values comprise factors such as comfortable life, assured family
security, self - respect and sense of wisdom.
 Whereas, factors such as ambitious goal, sense of moral conviction and courage,
undisputable honesty and imaginative thoughts have been included in the
instrumental values.
In addition to this, values are further classified into the
following categories:
1.Theoretical type: It refers to the combination of moral reasoning andthinking to
discover the truth.
2.Economic type: It refers to the practical application of enthusiasmand
interest in terms of earning and procuring wealth.
3.Aesthetic type: It refers to the personal taste of interest to appreciatethe natural
beauty and cultural heritage.
 4. Social type: It refers to the motivated interest for the welfare of thepeople.
 5. Political type: It refers to the obligation of interest towards theselection
of specific political power for the people in a democratic way.

ETHICS

 The word ethics is derived from the Greek word meaning as customs ortraditions.

Page 13 of 58

The term engineering ethics literally refers to the study that is concerned with
ethical and moral issues pertaining to the professional and engineering
organisations. ethic is a “system of moralprinciples, rules and conduct.” Ethics
is a “science of morals.” The words ethics has emerged from Latin ‘Ethicus’ or in
Greek ‘Ethicos’.
 Ethics is the word that refers to morals, values, and beliefs of the individuals,
family or the society. The word has several meanings. Basically it is an acti
vity and process of inquiry.

 Secondly, it is different from non-
moral problems, when dealing with issues and controversies.

 Thirdly, ethics refers to a particular set of beliefs, attitudes, and habits of
individuals or family or groups concerned with morals.
 Fourth, it is used to mean ‘morally correct
 The engineering ethics strongly focuses on the moral virtues, ideal characters,
committed policies and the social interactions of the individuals and
corporate sectors that are associated with the technical or technological
activities. Engineering ethics lays down the basic moral code of conduct and
professional commitment on the part of all sections of a community such as
workers, technical assistants, public individuals, professional engineers and
government employees.
 Engineering ethics also provides necessary solutions to deal with the conflicts
and confrontations faced by the engineers and corporate managers.
 ‘Right’, ‘Fair’ and ‘Proper’ are three terms normally used to express the
social behaviour of the people. When we tell these words, there are right and
wrong behaviour towards others; fair and unfair actions taken against someone or
for someone; or some fair or unfair decisions.
 The beliefs what is right, what is fair and what is proper are our beliefs and our

Page 14 of 58

moral standards. The beliefs differ from individual to individual, place to place and
time to time. What is right in one place or situation may be wrong in other
situation. The moral standards also differ based on moral value an individual
attaches. Any action can be termed good or right or bad or wrong are relative and
moral judgments. The problem has one more side that who is making the
judgment. From different sides the problem is seen in different light and
accordingly the judgment. The distinctions are made as ‘us’ and ‘others’ or
‘benefits’ and ‘obligations’.
 State the importance of ethics. (7 marks)

IMPORTANCE OF ETHICS
1. Part of Society:

 Business is part of society. Whatever ethical principle apply in society apply to
business. Example tax evasion is considered unethical in society. If a company
deliberately evades tax payments the company istreated unethical.

2.Expectations of Public:

 All stakeholders have an eye on the culture and behaviour of a business
organization due to dominance of economics in the society. The public expects a
high level of ethical behaviour from the business organisations.
 ‘Doing the right thing’, ‘Do no harm’ and ‘Good to all’ are the expectations of
general public from business. Example: a company manufacturing a tobacco
based products say ‘pan masalas’ and making advertisements appealing to college
students in not respected. Whereas a company that recalls unsafe product is
respected.
3. Trust of Employees
 High level of morale and productivity can be easily obtained in companies that
treat their all employees with equality, encourage good team and work culture, and

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 15 of 58

with ethical practices. The employees in the company as well as those connected
feel good and develop a mutual trust. Employees get attraction to ethically and
socially responsible companies.
4. Image
 An ethical organization command trust and respect of all its stakeholders. The
organization builds image for itself. Ethical good image is important because all
stakeholders stand to gain.
5. Costs

 Deterioration of relationships, damage to reputation and reduction of employee
productivity, loyalty that come out of unethical practices cost companies. An
uncaring employer will find it difficult to employ good professions for his
business.

6. Pride of Best Companies

 The ethically managed companies command respect from public as well as
government organisations. ‘Fortune’ magazine publishes yearly best companies.
Similarly Indian will managed companies are published by ‘Business India’.
These companies have a brand value and accepted as leaders in the industry.
The company policies with regards to profit sharing bonuses, social
responsibility, balance of work and social life arequoted.

 Differentiate morality & Ethics (7 marks)

 Define Integrity? (3 marks) INTEGRITY
 Integrity is one thing that every business should have. When employees follow
work ethics, they show integrity to the outside world. Customers believe in the
company and also business prospects increase. Every industry has its own ethical
guidelines, and a business should make sure that they follow these standards.
Integrity refers to the upright honesty and fair- mindedness to communicate the
exact truth to the individuals. The integrity would increase the self-respect of an
individual and also would enable him to command respect from others thereby
earning himthe prestigious social status.

ETHICS MORALITY

The word Ethics originated from the Greek
word ethos. The meaning of ethos is a character

The word Morals originated from
the Latin word Mos. The meaning of
Mos is custom.

Legal guidelines and professional rules govern
ethics. The acceptability of ethics is confined
within a particular space and time frame.

When it comes to the acceptability
of Morality it transcends the norms
laid down by culture.

Ethics are dependent on the prism of others. Morality is seen from the
perspective of an individual.

If the contexts are different then the ethics
could be different, hence there is some degree
of flexibility in ethics.

Change in Morality depends on the
change in the beliefs of an
individual.

Ethics are followed because society has decided
that it is the right course of action

Morality is followed because a
person believes that it is the right
course of action.

A person who follows the ethical principles
need not necessarily have strong moral values,
in fact, there are even possibilities that he may
not have any morals.

There could be situations where
ethics are violated by a moral person
to maintain to uphold his moral
values.
Ethics is something usually associated in the
field of law, medicine or business. Ethics does
not have a religious connotation.

Morality has a religious connotation

 Integrity is used to describe a person's level of honesty, moral commitments, and
willingness to do what's right. For example, we expect our doctors to be honest
with us about diagnoses, won't try to prescribe medications we don't need, and
will generally work in the best interest of our health and well-being. We expect
this because, in most societies, doctors are perceived to be people of great
integrity with strong moral compasses.
 Define Academic Integrity.(3 marks)
 Explain the five pillars of academic integrity 6 marks)
The integrity is of the following types
 a) ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: This refers to the lack of honesty among the
educational institutions and organizations. There has been an alarming increase in
the dishonesty and several sectors of educational institutes such as students,
workers, teaching faculty members and management. Academic integrity could
contribute to the successful educational career of the students thus paving a
definite way for the academic excellence.
 Academic integrity is the commitment to and demonstration of honest and moral
behavior in an academic setting. This is most relevant at the university level as it
relates to providing credit to other people when using their ideas. In simplest
terms, it requires acknowledging the contributions of other people. Failure to
provide such acknowledgement is considered plagiarism.
 In academic contexts and scholarly work, integrity is of tremendous importance.
For example, when college professors write books or perform experiments, it is
expected that their theories and assertions are backed up by rigorous research for
which they provide citations. In cases where it has been discovered that someone
has falsified research data or outright lied, that person can face a number of
consequences because he or she was expected to work with honesty and integrity.

FIVE PILLARS OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
The International Center for Academic Integrity (ICAI) has identified fivepillars
of academic integrity to generate positive conversations about integrity.

• PILLAR 1

 Honesty is sincerity. All other pillars of academic integrity have somebasis in
honesty. Honest individuals take stock of individual abilities and represent their
effort fairly.

 PILLAR 2

 Trust in other people and in your community eases working relationships. Trust
is established in a system where all members are doing their best work, where
structures and policies are fair and all willbe treated fairly.

• PILLAR 3

 Fairness goes hand in hand with trust. Every individual should believe that they
will be treated fairly and judged by the same standard as all others in the
community. For example, you can trust that your professors will evaluate all
work fairly and not favor one person over another. The best work comes out of a
fair system.

• PILLAR 4

 Respect allows for individual points of view and opinions to be shared. Students
show respect by “listening to other points of view, being prepared, meeting
deadlines, and performing to the best of their ability.” Instructors show respect by
listening to students’ ideas and “providing full and honest feedback.”

• PILLAR 5

 Responsibility means acknowledging your agency and accountabilityin
daily actions and in your work. Everyone is personally invested in

Page 19 of 58

performing their work with integrity and encourages others to act with
integrity too. Academic integrity starts with individuals andpositively
influences the entire community.
The basic essence of academic integrity is contaminated by the
following dishonest acts
 Cheating: Student community resort to various modes of cheating acts such as
copying in the university examinations and adopting the unscrupulous techniques
in chasing of university examination papers and for bribing the concerned
authorities for bogus mark sheets. Nowadays, leakage of question papers prior to
the conduct of the competitive examination is a good example for this
category.
 Fabrication: This includes the unethical alteration of marks in the original mark
sheets and resorting to submit a fake or false mark sheets to gain admission in
professional colleges.
 Plagiarism: This refers to unethical duplication of data or theoretical information
from the records already published. There has been a steady increase in the
duplicated and manipulated data in the submission of project works and thesis.
 Misinterpretation: This refers to the failure to provide correct and true statements
to the concerned authorities with reference to academic activities.
 Sabotage and theft: It refers to the gross misbehavior and indiscipline among
the section of student community to resort to violent activities by damaging the
properties of educational institutions such as college laboratory equipments and
library. Similarly, stealing of worthy journals, publications and books in the library
by a few groups of students, also cause social concern among academicians.

 Define Work ethics.(3 marks)

WORK ETHICS

 Industry and Society are the two systems which interact with each other and are
interdependent. Society requires industry/business system which provides
manufacturing, distribution and consumption activities. It needs investment
(capital input), labor (input), supply (raw materials), production (industries,
business organizations), marketing and distribution (transport), and consumption
(public, customer). A lot of transactions (and interactions between
these sub-stems involving people are needed for the welfare
of the society. It is here, the work ethics plays an essential role.
 Work ethics is defined as a set of attitudes concerned with the value of
work, which forms the motivational orientation. In simple terms, work ethics
means the moral value in association with thespecific accountability
of an individual towards the responsible
discharging of his duties.
 Traditionally, work ethic has been understood as a value based on hard work and
diligence. Capitalists, for example, believe in the necessity of working hard and in
consequential ability of enhancing one’s character.
 Socialists suggest that a concept of “hard work” is deluding the working class into
being loyal workers of the elite; and working hard, in itself, is not necessarily an
honorable thing, but simply a way to create greater wealth for those at the summit
of the economic pyramid.
 The term work ethics is more suitable for a person who possesses the inclination
for hard work with a sense of dedication and integrity. Work ethics has become a
crucial criteria for the proper development of an industrial organisation.
Interpersonal capability, initiative efforts and dependability are the three
essential aspects of work ethics.

 Explain the basic work ethics for an organization?(7 marks)

BASIC WORK ETHICS FOR AN ORGANIZATION
 Ideally, the policies a business operates with are compassion, fairness,honor,
responsibility, and integrity. One of the best ways to communicate organizational
ethics is by training employees about company standards. Basic work ethics for
any organization should include:
• 1. Uniform rules and regulations: An ethical organizational example is the
common treatment of all staff, i.e., with the same respect, regardless of race,
culture, religion, or lifestyle, with equal chances for promotion. Therefore, small
company managers should desist from favoring any one employee, for it can
lead to lawsuits andis also highly counterproductive.
• 2. Communication of the rules and regulation to all employees:
Company policies must be clearly communicated to each employee with a
transparency at all levels of the hierarchy. Employees are the spine of all
organizations and should have a say in the goals and objectives of a firm.
•3. Respect for Employees: Respect employees and in return receive the same.
Regulations should not be so rigid, and therefore, don’t expect staff to attend
work two days before a marriage. If somebody is not well, don’t ask them to
attend office unless or until there’s an emergency.

• 4. Allow a degree of freedom to employees without constant micro-
management: Key roles of responsibility need to be establishedon the first day of

joining with responsibilities commensurate with a person’s expertise.
Employees should be inducted into training if needed.
• 5. Clear cut salary and promotion policy: Employees crib if they are underpaid.
Make sure they get what is deserved and decided in the presence of the person. A
major attrition factor is a poor appraisal, promotion prospects are ideally based on

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 22 of 58

merit, not favor. Clarity is crucial.
•6. Clear and uniform holiday schedule: It is the responsibility of human
resource professionals to prepare the holiday calendar at the beginning of the
year and circulate the same among all employees.
•7.Effects of Work Ethics within an organization: Preferably a
Work place ethic culture will ensure that employers guide and mentor staff
appropriately while managementtreats all as equal.Transparency is
essential.

 There are at least four elements that aim to create an ethicalbehavioral
culture of employees within an organization.
• A written code of ethics and standards (ethical code).
• Ethics training for executives, managers, and employees.
• The availability of ethical situational advice (i.e. advice lines oroffices).
• A confidential reporting system.
Step 1: Be professional about your work
 Professionalism is beyond a clean shirt, for it includes one’s values, attitude, and
demeanor. Practice being cordial and positive while refraining from gossip.
Knowing how to communicate constructively and positively, while respecting the
feelings of others is an invaluable tool. Respect others and develop a reputation
for having integrity, meaning honesty, fairness, and consistency in what you do
and say. Reliability and honesty: Work ethic is more than completing long hours
for its foundation is integrity. To develop integrity, one can:
 Act the same when people are not watching you, as when they are.

 Perform consistently at the same level of quality. Be conscientious. Behonest in
all things.
 Honesty isn’t a business policy, it is a state of mind.
 Be consistent in delivering good quality work and earn good reputation:
Everything worthwhile accomplishing requires discipline.Remain focused on a
long-term goal while avoiding getting side- tracked by a short-term
gratification. To be persistent and able to follow through on assignments...
Train yourself.

• Step 2: Manage your time

 Know your strength and weaknesses (including potential distractions, so you
can avoid them): Evaluate work. Identifying one’s weaknesses and making a
plan to improve these areas builds a stronger work ethic. One way of evaluating
this is to create a list summarizing the skills and requirements of your work, and
the strengths and weaknesses. Be honest about weaknesses, and what it is that
distracts you – this is stepone in learning to manage those weaknesses.
 Set yourself deadlines for delivering even small tasks: Being able to complete
your tasks and finish what you start, is an essential part of character building. You
cannot imagine a fully mature, fully functioning person who is unable to finish
what she begins. The development of this habit is the key to long-term
success. Don’t waste time by doing stuff that is not important. Constantly
evaluate to check which things absolutely must get done.
 Prioritize tasks and set the most important ones in the morning: Complete
projects and tasks immediately. A trademark behavior of a worker with a poor
work ethic is delaying work until another day, which usually only leads to an
incomplete or late project.
 Avoid procrastination: Procrastinating is a great waste. Imagine all that could be
accomplished by eliminating procrastination from this moment on. To overcome

Page 24 of 58

procrastination, first realize that it’s not the real issue. Procrastination, laziness,
bad time management, or lack of discipline, are merely symptoms of the issue. The
real reason is beneath this. You can also use the Pomodoro technique to avoid
procrastination.
 Avoid negative talk and gossip: Keep the lazy, the negative minded, and the
unproductive, at arm’s length, for it’s a psychological prison. Associate with
ambitious, hard-working people, and soon count yourself amongst them. Provide
feedback that improves situations and builds people up. Be an active listener and
keep an open mind.
Step 3: Keep a balance and deliver consistent high performance work
Do sport, sleep well, and socialize: Play is best when it’s earned, equally sleep. Earn
sleep by working hard on one’s goals in the day. A good work ethic isn’t just being
glued to a computer. It is also understanding how to take care with decent sleep,
and eating nutritiously. Take time to relax and recharge while keeping priorities
in your life clear, helps maintain a good perspective at work.
Step 4: Develop good work habits

 Steer the self-development path towards choosing to be an employee with a
strong ethic, after all, creating a habit for oneself is really a question of being an
action- minded person. The ‘doing component’ flows easily when embracing the
‘being part.’
 Create and learn habits: Values to inculcate and habitualize:
 Valuing punctuality and attendance.
 Valuing time, orderliness, neatness, and speed.
 Working smarter but not harder; being psychologically self-employed.
 Playing an internal game of working, yet enjoying the importance of relaxation
and rest.

“Do it now” habit: Never leave ‘till tomorrow what can be accomplished
today.’ Good ethics habitualize attitude, action, and inevitably – consequence: how
you do, what you do in this moment.

Other Good Habits

 Concentration is the ability to stay on a task until it is completed, by
working in a straight line to get from where one is, without distraction or
diversion, to the destination, i.e., completion of the work.
• Get off to a good start.
 Clean up and get organized.
 Plan activities.
 Streamline work and emphasize the important work.
 Concentrate on one work task at a time until completion.
 Work steadily.
 Make smart use of technology.
 Be in control of office paper, work in-basket, and e-mail.
 Multitask on routine matters.
 Make better use of time.
 Explain the Core Elements of a Strong Work Ethics? (14 marks)
 It is difficult to define the elements of good work ethics, as it is such an
individualistic approach and thinking. What may be good work ethics for me may
not be the same for you.
 Much depends upon how each organization or person looks at work ethics and the
moral values that each follows. What moral values you practice in daily life will
define your attitude towards work and your work ethics. But there are a few
common elements that are universally followed and employers look for it in their

Page 26 of 58

employees.
 1. Honesty: This is the core element of work ethics, all the other elements are
based upon your honesty. Be honest about your successes and failures, take credit
only where due, do not steal other’s works or ideas, and own up to your failures.
 2. Integrity: Do not let people down, try to fulfill your commitments, andbe
consistent in your thoughts, action and behavior.

everyone as equals.
 4. Alertness: Be aware of what is happening around and keep an eye onthings.
5. Openness: Share your ideas, results and resources with the other team
members, so that everyone has the same opportunity and know what you are
doing. Being secretive is counterproductive.
 6 Respect for others: No matter how urgent a deadline or heated that tempers
become, remain diplomatic and poised and show grace under pressure. Whether
serving a client, meeting a customer or meeting with management, do the best to
respect other’s opinions, even in stressful circumstances. It shows one values
other’s individual worth and professional contribution.
 7. Reliability and Dependability: Means being punctual for work and meetings,

problems with purpose and resilience. Push on, no matter how far it is necessary to
go.

 9. Dedication: Continue until the job is complete, and delivered. “It’s good
enough” is not sufficient for you and the team, as you aim to be “outstanding” in
content and quality. Put in the extra hours to get things right by attending to detail
and excellence.
 10.Accountability: Accept responsibility personally for one’s actions and
outcomes in all situations, plus avoid excuses when work does not proceed as
planned – admitting mistakes or oversights are used as a learning curve and will
not be repeated again. Employers expect employees to attain to high standards,
and they should fully support staff who accepts responsibility, instead of passing
the buck.
 11. Confidentiality: Any confidential information of documents you have should
remain confidential. You cannot discuss it or show it to anyone else, other than
the people authorized to do so.
 12. Responsibility: Take responsibility for your thoughts, actions, behavior and
work.

law to fit your agenda.

world, to how others are treated, professionalism is such a very broad category
that it encompasses all the elements of a work ethic.
 16. Humility: Acknowledge other’s contribution, and share credit for successes.
You have integrity and are open to learning from mentors and others, even as you
teach via your action, example, and words. Though you take the work seriously,
you are also maintaining a sense of humor about yourself.
 17. Initiative: Do not be afraid to put forth your ideas or volunteer for work.

Possession of above - said qualities of work ethics of an individual or employee
would shape himself into a qualitative and competent worker. These employees
with awareness on the work ethics would contribute to an increased productivity of
an organization thus fulfilling the expectations and achievement goals of their
organizations. These days a work ethics is important in many situations. It is a skill
that can be learned by every person and has so often proved to be the path of success
for many. All businesses give a higher regard to an ethical employee, and hiring staff
with positive ethics is appreciated around the world.
 Define Service Learning? (3 marks)

SERVICE LEARNING

 Service-learning refers to learning that actively involves students in a wide
range of experiences, which often benefit others and the community, while
also advancing the goals of a given curriculum. Inmost of the universities,
service learning has been made compulsory for the students in the form of NSS.
 Service learning provides better opportunities to the student community to
understand the practical problems faced by the common public. Students are better
trained to provide assistance and counseling about education, agriculture, hygiene,
welfare schemes and health to the urban and village people. Service learning
imparts valuable guidance and career training to the students not only about the
academic curriculum but also the social commitment and moral values to become
the responsible citizens. Enough provisions have been made in the academic
curriculum and syllabi to award ranks/credits for the active participation of
students in community services.

ROLE OF COMMUNITY & SCHOOL CURRICULUM IN
THEPROPAGATION OF CIVIC VIRTUES &

CHARACTERS

 By making appropriate changes in the basic pattern of academic curriculum, the
essentials of civic virtues could be actively focused to the student community.
Students should be motivated and encouraged to learn the principles of civic
virtues to show their academic excellence. When the students are exposed to the
moral values, their practical knowledge about current trends of civilization and
globalization would be much enhanced to be a dutiful citizen.
 There is a compulsory role of teachers at lower and higher education levels for
imparting the essential goal of civic virtues. They can design and formulate their
own methods to teach the basics of civic virtues and the drastic consequences in
not learning them.
 The learning and teaching procedures could be made more innovative and
purposeful by involving the parental and community associations. This would
help the students to sort out and identify the common civic problems and
interference that seriously threaten the honest efforts of the student community.
Consistent co-operation and monitoring by the academic management and teachers
would improve and strengthen the attitude and interest of the students about the
importance of civic virtues. Suitable provisions should be made to reward and
encourage the students who have shown keen interest and enthusiasm to acquire
the basics of civic virtues and their applications.

RESPECT FOR OTHERS

 Self - respect and respect for others are the basic constituents of a typical moral
conduct and discipline that plays an important factor in the behavioral pattern and
life - style of an individual. When the youngchildren and students, tend to be aware
of this moral conduct, they are prompted to give respect to their parents, teachers,
public and elders. This type of positive behavioral trend would certainly help to
boost- up the personality and individuality of a person. Respect, also called
esteem, is a positive feeling or action shown towards someone or something
considered important, or held in high esteem or regard. It conveys a sense of
admiration for good or valuable qualities. And it is also the process of honoring
someone by exhibiting care, concern, or consideration for their needs or feelings.
 When an individual or person acquires the modest act of showing respect to
others, he/she would be entitled to get the appreciation and support from all
sections of a society for his/her well - mannered conduct. Some people may earn
the respect of individuals by assisting others or by playing important social roles.
In many cultures, individuals are considered to be worthy of respect until they
prove otherwise. Courtesies that show respect may include simple words and
phrases like "Thank you" in the West or "Namaste" in the Indian subcontinent, or
simple physical signs like a slight bow, a smile, direct eye contact, or a simple
handshake; however, those acts may have very different interpretations,
depending on the cultural context.

LIVING PEACEFULLY

 It is a reasonable ambition of every individual to lead a peaceful and healthy
life. In modern world, several philosophical advocates have suggested various
measures to have a peaceful life which is free from tension and excitement.
Peaceful mind is essential for a healthy and comfortable life. To live in peace, an
individual should have the mental contentment and satisfaction. Various social
and psychological factors such as poverty, over-ambition, jealousy and
discontentment directly affect the process of peaceful living. Social conflicts and
confrontations such as racial discrimination, religious violence and offences also
affectthe peaceful living.
 The basic concept of peaceful living is also disturbed and defeated by the failure
to follow the moral values and self-discipline. Several imbalances in the human
culture and civilization also affect the standard of peaceful living.
 To live peacefully, one should start install peace within (self). Charity begins at
home. Then one can spread peace to family, organization where one works, and
then to the world, including the environment. Only who are at peace can spread

peace. You cannot gift an article which you do not possess. The essence of
oriental philosophy is that one should not fight for peace. It is oxymoron. War or
peace can be won only by peace, and not by wars!
 Individuals are exposed to various types of stresses and strains due to their
family, communal and social factors. The constant exposures to these
psychological disturbances lead to impatience and anger thereby upsetting the
peaceful mind. Several medical reports and psychotherapists have suggested
various procedures and methods to reduce tension for restoring the peaceful life.

 Describe the qualities required for a peaceful life? (7 marks)

SUGGESTIVE MEASURES TO LEAD A PEACEFUL LIVING
 1.Development of disciplined orderliness: When an individual is subjected to
mental stress due to several factors, he could lead a peaceful life through
disciplined and civilized cultures. By developing the orderly behaviour, an
individual could regain the peaceful mind. Any uncivilized behavioural acts
finally result in the loss of peaceful mind thereby affecting the morality of that
individual.
 2. Reorientation of the personal commitment: Any unwanted involvement with
an excess burdening of the life style could cause various problems such as changes
in the personality and behaviour pattern of an individual. Excess commitments in
the social community programmes would make a person to earn the displeasures
and critical comments from others. These displeasures and unwanted arguments
would subject the concerned individual to lose patience, self-respect and balance
of mind. Finally, that person would tend to show violence and arrogance in his
behavioral activity thus losing his peaceful and contented life.
 3.Physical exercise programmes: When persons volunteer to spend considerable
time for physical exercises such as walking, jogging or playing games, they

Page 34 of 58

derive mental happiness and consolation to avoid stressful and strained life.
 4.Mental exercise programmes: Several research studies have proved that
several mental exercises such as meditation and yoga could provide a magical
cure for those suffering from several health disorders. The constant practice of
meditation and yoga could tone up the mental depression and psychological
imbalances thus motivating aperson to have a peaceful life.
 5.Development of self-reliance and self-control: It has become a common
problem to understand that more individuals tend to lose their patience, when they
face domestic and professional conflicts. Loss of patience and temperament may
be caused by sudden act of irritation and provocation. As a consequence, the
concerned person enters into the state of mental discomfort and instability that
would eventually disturb the process of peaceful living. These problems could be

successfully managed by practicing the positive act of self-reliance, self-
confidence and self-control. These behavioral managements would relieve a

person from the sources of stress and confusion for therestoration of peaceful life.
 Explain the role of caring & sharing in work place? (7 marks)

CARING &SHARING

 The attitude and tendency of understanding and sharing feelings of others is the
essence of caring. The process of caring includes the personal caring, family
caring and community caring. The act of caring has become an important aspect
of human civilization and ethical conduct. The process of caring promotes and
strengthens the bond of love and affinity. Thus reflecting the magnanimous
attitude of a person. The process of caring is the basic tool of social justice and
dignified conduct. The other features of caring is better illustrated by the
examples.
 A devoted teacher should be prompt enough to help a student to solve a
mathematical problem, when the student finds it difficult. A teacher should play a
neutral role to solve a moral problem or crisis between the students thus restoring

the climate of harmony.
 Caring is feeling for others. It is a process which exhibits the interest in, and
support for, the welfare of others with fairness, impartiality and justice in all
activities, among the employees, in the context of professional ethics. It includes
showing respect to the feelings of others, and also respecting and preserving the
interests of all others concerned. Caring is reflected in activities such as
friendship, membership in social clubs and professional societies, and
through various transactions in the family, fraternity, community, country and in
international councils. In the present day context, caring for the environment
(including the fauna and flora) has become a necessity for our very survival. If we
do not care for the environment, the environment will scare us.
 What are the features of caring? (7 marks)

CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF CARING

 1. Caring as an essence of moral values: The process of caring is learnt and
followed in life, through moral values and virtues such as honesty,
trustworthiness and humility. When a person follows the basics of caring,
various modes of moral values are spontaneously inducted into his character, thus
making him a respected and prestigious personality.
 2.Caring as the heart of ethics: The process of caring constitutes the basic
foundation of ethical conduct and behaviour. Those individuals who respect the
ethics of caring, possess the noble qualities to work and dedicate for the welfare
of others.
 3.Caring to fulfill one’s obligations: A person who has been committed to the act
of caring, is able to understand and visualize the options and obligations of others
for the final fulfillment of a goal. Moreover, he tends to translate his thoughts into
a real action for himself and others. He becomes highly devoted to contribute his
assistance and efforts to make the life of others a peaceful and comfortable one.

 4.The ultimate goal of caring: To cater the basic needs of others for their
well-being is the ultimate goal of caring. Caring enables a right person to do

anything that he wants to do for himself. The mentality and interest for the well-
being of others without any selfishness is alsothe true aspect of caring.

 5.Caring as an experienced learning: The essential features of caring could be
gradually learnt through proper experience with commitmentand dedication.
 All the practical experiences of a person are neatly consolidated to appreciate the
logics of caring. The tendency of caring gradually enhances the intensity of
learning with rich experience.

INTERACTION BETWEEN LISTENING & CARING
 Listening is identified as an important constituent in the act of caring. There is a
close interaction between listening and caring. The essence of caring remains
incomplete and meaningless without caring. The combination of listening and
caring provide a keen and unbiased senseof self-judgement to a person.
According to the available reports, the act of listening could be well
developed by the following factors.
 1.Personal acknowledgement: This includes the communication of any message
through verbal or non- verbal manner.
 2. Response to the message: A person should reciprocate to any verbal
communication. This positive response would accelerate the act of caring. In
contrast, when a person remains without any response and silent for any verbal
message, act of caring will not further develop andbecomes purposeless.
 3. The process of interpretation and summary: On receiving any verbal
communication, the person should explain the status of the message such as likes,
dislikes, pleasant and unpleasant feelings and also desires. He should be able to
brief or summarise the statements for better focusing of the ideas and views.

Page 37 of 58

 4.Probing approach: A person who is much interested in listening and caring,
must have the probing approach to have a clear assessment of facts thereby
avoiding the confusions, suspicisions and conflicts.
 5.Application of silence: The process of keeping silent with patience would be a
right step to promote the act of listening and caring. When a person gives a silent
hearing to any information or conversation, he plans a better strategy for
transparent discussion of the concerned matter towards taking a correct decision.
 Define Sharing.(3 marks)

SHARING

 Primarily, caring influences ‘sharing’. Sharing is a process that describes the
transfer of knowledge (teaching, learning, and information), experience
(training), commodities (material possession) and facilities with others. The
transfer should be genuine, legal, positive, voluntary, and without any
expectation in return. However, the proprietary information it should not be
shared with outsiders. Through this process of sharing, experience, expertise,
wisdom and other benefits reach more people faster. Sharing is voluntary and it
cannot be driven by force, but motivated successfully through ethical principles.
 In short, sharing is ‘charity’ For the humanity, ‘sharing’ is a culture. The
‘happiness and wealth’ are multiplied and the ‘crimes and sufferings’ are reduced,
by sharing. It paves the way for peace and obviates militancy. Philosophically, the
sharing maximizes the happiness for all the human beings. In terms of
psychology, the fear, divide, and distrust between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’
disappear. Sharing not only paves the way to prosperity, early and easily, and
sustains it. Economically speaking, benefits are maximized as there is no wastage
or loss, and everybody gets one’s needs fulfilled and satisfied. Commercially
speaking, the profit is maximized. Technologically, the productivity and utilization
are maximized by sharing.

 6. True commitment with a sense of dedication and involvement.

 Define honesty.(3 marks)

HONESTY

 Honesty is speaking the truth. Saying things that aren't true, or thatyou think
might not be true, or that you are making up to hide the truth are all types of
lies. Lying is not honest (also called being dishonest) because you are saying
something that isn't true.
 Examples of what speaking the honest truth means:

• Honesty means you don't say things about people that aren't true.
You are not being honest if you make up rumors about someone
or if you share rumors someoneelse made up.
• Being honest means you admit to your actions, even if you'll get
in trouble. You are not being honest if you denyyou did something
wrong when you really did it.
• Honesty means you explain how a situation really happened. You
are not being honest if you say somethinghappened one way when
it really happened another way.

 Presentation of truth or open fact is the best quality or a trademark ofhonesty.
Honest persons are always respected and honoured by the society for their
truthful character. Although an honest person may face some hurdles or barriers
to achieve his target in the initial period,he will be suitably rewarded with an
ultimate success to fulfil his goal of achievement in the later period.
 Several epic poems in all international languages have focused on theimportance
of honesty to be practiced in daily life. When the honesty is incorporated into the
characters of children and youth, they can blossom in to matured people with a
strong mental willpower and good moral conduct for a bright future. The basic

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 40 of 58

essence of honesty is manifested, when the individuals respect their inner
thoughts and consciousness to perform their duties to the entire satisfaction of
theiremployers and common public.
 How honesty is exhibited?(6 marks)
 Differentiate Truthfulness & Trustworthiness.(5 marks)
Honesty is a virtue, and it is exhibited in two aspects namely,
 TRUTHFULNESS AND TRUSTWORTHINESS
 Truthfulness is to face the responsibilities upon telling truth. One should
keep one’s word or promise. By admitting one’s mistake committed (one
needs courage to do that!), it is easy to fix them. Reliable engineering
judgment, maintenance of truth, defending the truth, and communicating
the truth, only when it does ‘good’ to others, are some of the reflections of
truthfulness.
 But trustworthiness is maintaining integrity and taking responsibility for
personal performance. People abide by law and live by mutual trust. They
play the right way to win, according to the laws or rules (legally and
morally). They build trust through reliability and authenticity. They admit
their own mistakes and confront unethical actions in others and take tough
and principled stand, even if unpopular.
Honesty is mirrored in many ways. The common reflectionsare
• Beliefs (intellectual honesty).
• Communication (writing and speech).
• Decisions (ideas, discretion).
• Actions (means, timing, place, and the goals) and
• Intended and unintended results achieved.
As against this, some of the actions of an engineer that leads to
dishonesty are
• 1. Lying: Honesty implies avoidance of lying. An engineer may

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 41 of 58

communicate wrong or distorted test results intentionally or otherwise. It is
giving wrong information to the right people.
• 2. Deliberate deception: An engineer may judge or decide on matters one
is not familiar or with insufficient data or proof, to impress upon the
customers or employers. This is a self-deceit.
• 3. Withholding the information: It means hiding the facts during
communication to one’s superior or subordinate,
intentionally or otherwise.
• 4. Not seeking the truth: Some engineers accept the informationor data,
without applying their mind and seeking the truth.
• 5. Not maintaining confidentiality: It is giving right information to wrong
people. The engineers should keep information of their customers/clients or
of their employers confidential and should notdiscuss them with others.
Giving professional judgment under the influence of extraneous factors
such as personal benefits and prejudice. The laws, experience, social
welfare, and even conscience are given a go-bye by such actions. Certainly
this is a higher-order crime.

 The act of honesty could contribute not only to the credibility, but also to an
enhanced social status of an individual. Most moral and ethical theories have
advocated that an honest person could contribute to the desirable changes
in a community by the way of his two primary virtues such as truthfulness
and trustworthiness.
 Define Courage.(3 marks)
 Explain the various classification of courage? (7 marks)

COURAGE

 Courage is the tendency to accept and face risks and difficult tasks in rational
ways. Self-confidence is the basic requirement to nurture courage. Courage is
classified into three types, based on the types of risks, namely

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 42 of 58

 Physical courage,
 Social courage, and
 Intellectual courage.
 In physical courage, the thrust is on the adequacy of the physical strength,
including the muscle power and armaments. People with highadrenalin, may be
prepared to face challenges for the mere ‘thrill‘or driven by a decision to ‘excel‘.
 The social courage involves the decisions and actions to change the order,
based on the conviction for or against certain social behaviors.This requires
leadership abilities, including empathy and sacrifice, tomobilize and motivate
the followers, for the social cause.
 The intellectual courage is inculcated in people through acquired knowledge,
experience, games, tactics, education, and training. In professional ethics,
courage is applicable to the employers, employees,public, and the press.
 Look before you leap. One should perform Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities,
and Threat (SWOT) analysis. Calculate (estimate) the risks, compare with one‘s
strengths, and anticipate the end results, while taking decisions and before getting
into action. Learning from the past helps. Past experience (one‘s own or
borrowed!) and wisdom gained from self-study or others will prepare one to plan
and act with self- confidence, succeed in achieving the desired ethical goals
through ethical means. Opportunities and threat existing and likely to exist in
future are also to be studied and measures to be planned. This anticipatory
management will help anyone to face the future with courage.
 The courageous act is always associated with the disciplined character. When a
person possesses the courageous character in combination with self- discipline, he
is sure to check a success through his determined efforts. The act of courage
could infuse a positive thinking in the minds of people and enhances the power of
tolerance. Individuals with a courageous character are not discouraged and
confused over the failures. Instead, they become ensured to keep on trying and
struggling to reach the successful target with the enhanced motivation. The act of

courage strengthens the mental caliber and personal integrity of an individual for
the proper management of the critical problems without any fear and
disappointment. Courageous persons would be so determined to the act
against any social injustice or evil with the sense of moral devotion and
commitment thus not minding their personal discomfort.
 Facing the criticism, owning responsibility, and accepting the mistakesor errors
when committed and exposed are the expressions of courage. In fact, this sets
their mind to be vigilant against the past mistakes, andcreative in finding the
alternate means to achieve the desired objectives.
Prof. Sathish Dhawan, Chief of ISRO, was reported to have exhibited his courage
and owned responsibility, when the previous space mission failed, but credited
Prof. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam (now our revered President), when the subsequent
mission succeeded.
 State the features of a courageous person. (4 marks)
The courageous people own and have shown the following characteristics, in
their professions:
 Perseverance (sustained hard work),
 Experimentation (preparedness to face the challenges, that is,
unexpected or unintended results),
 Involvement (attitude, clear and firm resolve to act), and
 Commitment (willing to get into action and to reach the desired goals byany
alternative but ethical means).

Define Co-operation.(3 marks)

CO-OPERATION

 It is a team-spirit present with every individual engaged in engineering. Co-
operation is an activity between two persons or sectors that aims at integration of

operations (synergy), while not sacrificing the autonomy of either party. Further,
working together ensures, coherence, i.e., blending of different skills required,

Page 44 of 58

towards common goals. Willingness to understand others, think and act
together and putting this into practice, is cooperation. Cooperation promotes
collinearity, coherence (blend), co-ordination (activities linked in sequence or
priority) and the synergy (maximizing the output, by reinforcement).
 According to professional ethics, cooperation should exist or be developed, and
maintained, at several levels; between the employers and employees, between the
superiors and subordinates, among the colleagues, between the producers and the
suppliers (spare parts), and between the organisation and its customers. The codes
of ethics of various professional societies insist on appropriate cooperation to
nourish the industry. The absence of cooperation leads to lack of communication,
misinformation, void in communication, and undue delay between supply,
production, marketing, and consumption. This islikely to demoralize and frustrate
the employees, leading to collapse of the industry over time and an economic loss
to the society.
 Enumerate the impediments to successful co-operation.(7 marks)
The impediments to successful co-operation are:
 Clash of ego of individuals.
 Lack of leadership and motivation.
 Conflicts of interests, based on region, religion, language, and caste.
 Ignorance and lack of interest.
By careful planning, motivation, leadership, fostering and rewardingteam work,
professionalism and humanism beyond the ‘divides‘, training on appreciation to
different cultures, mutual understanding ‘cooperation‘ can be developed and also
sustained.
 State the objectives of co-operation(4 marks)
OBJECTIVES OF CO-OPERATION
• Team spirit with active involvement.
• Unified and coordinated efforts.

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 45 of 58

• Motivation for public welfare.
• Service mindedness with honesty and integrity without any
expectation for personal benefit.
• Sharing identical views for the common goals.
• Democratic participation with dedication for the welfare of a nation or
community. Voluntary acceptance to the outcome of co- operative efforts.
The social and political architecture of any nation is based on the concept
of co-operation. It is a worth mentioning to point out that liberation
movements in several countries including India for procuring independent
freedom from the clutches of rulers, had been achieved only through
the co- operative movement and struggle. Any social or community

conflict could be amicably settled and solved through the co-
operative movements. The legitimate interests of any subject are fully

protected without any violation by means of co- operation.

 The process of co-operation creates a strong network of bonding by which social
harmony and cultural traditions are fully protected. Right from ancient time

onwards, vedic scholars and philosophers have underlined the importance of co-
operation in the restoration of democratic rights and justice.

 It has become the moral obligation of every individual to cultivate and develop
the sense of co-operation for the betterment of community or organization with
which he is associated

 Define Commitment.( 3 marks)

COMMITMENT

 Commitment means alignment to goals and adherence to ethical principles during
the activities. One must believe in one‘s action performed and the expected end
results (confidence). Holding sustained interest and firmness, in whatever ethical
means one follows, with the fervent attitude and hope that one will achieve the
goals, is commitment.It is the driving force to realize success. Commitment means

Page 46 of 58

acceptance of the responsibilities and duties and cooperation means help and
assistance. By developing team commitment and cooperation in a work team you
are assisting the team to meet its goals and objectives. Work teams that are
committed and cooperative are more likely to achieve the goals the business has
set.
There are a number of signals that indicate the work team is committed.
These include:
 maintaining or increasing quality
 reaching or exceeding production targets
 decreasing complaints from team members
 limited conflict between team members
 Fewer workplace injuries.
 There are degrees of team involvement in decision making. Your knowledge of
the skills and abilities of the team members will guide your decision about the extent
supported employees can contribute to making a decision. There are no rules for
when and how team members should be involved. It is a matter for your
judgment. The following diagram shows the degrees of involvement team
members may have. At the highest level of involvement the team identifies and
solves problems, and brings recommendations to the supervisor. At the lowest
level of involvement the team plays no role in the decision making at all.Between
these two extremes the supervisor and team may make the decision together,
or the supervisor may outline the problem and constraints for solving it (time,
money, etc) and hand it over to the teamto solve.

High involvement to no involvement

 Involving team members in decision making, which can include problem solving,
should be based on whether one or more of the following is met. The need for
acceptance. The greater the need for the team to accept your decisions, the more
you should involve them.
• The effect the decision will have on the team. The more the problem or
decision affects the team, the more you should involve them. Their
involvement in implementing the decision. If the teamwill be implementing
or carrying out the decision, involve them. The ability and desire of the
group to become involved. If the team wants to be involved, consider
involving them, particularly if they have sufficient knowledge or expertise
in the issue involved. Even if they do not, it could be useful for training and
development purposes.
• The tendency for commitment is much required for the perfect completion
or execution of any personal or professional affair. Lack of commitment
and enthusiasm may not contribute to any successful achievement of any
task.
• Execution of any academic or professional task without the commitment

may not yield the expected result.
• State the characteristic features of commitment .(6 marks)
The characteristic features of commitment are mentioned asfollows.
• Consistent efforts
• Tendency of caring
• Reliable approach
• Dependable attitude
• Duty consciousness
• Sense of integrity
• Dedicated loyalty.
 Commitment is considered to be a voluntary and spontaneous act and is not
enforced by any compulsion or authoritative act. Commitment cannot be formally
registered by any act of pact or written statement. Butit is the original expression of
mental attitude of an individual for an active involvement in any task. A person
with a true sense of commitment is prepared to forgo his conveniences and
comforts for the sake of welfare of others. It is also evident to say that selfishness
is totally eradicated by the true application of commitment.
 Explain the different types of commitment? (7 marks)

DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMMITMENTS

 1. Any commitment to work or task refers to the application of mental thinking
and inclination to take up any work with a sense of perfection.
 2. Professional commitment refers to the sensible attitude of
involvement for the sustained growth of an organization.
 3. Any commitment to a customer refers to the sincere and satisfactoryservice to
the expectations of a customer.
 4. Any commitment to a friend refers to the true symbol of spirit and enthusiasm
for mutual help and service to justify the true symbol of friendship.
 Any commitment to a nation refers to the patriotic sacrifice to uphold the

integrity and sovereignty of a country.
The development of tendency for commitment could induce a self- realization
and self-confidence to serve for the community or society. The common public,
students, teachers and professionals should make it as a compulsory criterion to
develop and also cultivate the act ofcommitment for the sake of both personal and
community welfare benefits. The act of commitment leads to the building up of
disciplined character and conduct. It provides the natural instinct with anticipated
efforts for the honest sharing of the problems of others.

 Define Empathy.(3 marks)

EMPATHY

 Empathy is social radar. Sensing what others feel about, without their open talk,
is the essence of empathy. Empathy begins with showing concern, and then
obtaining and understanding the feelings of others, from others‘ point of view. It
is also defined as the ability to put one‘s self into the psychological frame or
reference or point of view of another, to know what the other person feels. It
includes the imaginative projection into other‘s feelings and understanding of
other‘s background such as parentage, physical and mental state, economic
situation, and association. This is an essential ingredient for good human relations
andtransactions.
 Enumerate the features of empathy.(7 marks)
To practice ‘Empathy‘, a leader must have or develop in him, the following
characteristics
 Understanding others: It means sensing others feelings and perspectives, and
taking active interest in their welfare.
 Service orientation: It is anticipation, recognition and meeting the needs of the
clients or customers.
 Developing others: This means identification of their needs and bolstering their
abilities. In developing others, the one should inculcate in him the listening
skill‘first.

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 50 of 58

 Communication : 22% reading and writing + 23% speaking + 55% listening
 One should get the feedback, acknowledge the strength and accomplishments,
and then coach the individual, by informing about what was wrong, and giving
correct feedback and positive expectation of the subject‘s abilities and the
resulting performance. Leveraging diversity (opportunities through diverse
people): This leads to enhanced organizational learning, flexibility, and
profitability.
 Political awareness: It is the ability to read political and social currentsin
an organization.
The benefits of empathy include:
 Good customer relations (in sales and service, in partnering).
 Harmonious labor relations (in manufacturing).
 Good vendor-producer relationship (in partnering.)
 Through the above three, we can maximize the output and profit, as wellas
minimizing the loss.
 While dealing with customer complaints, empathy is very effective inrealising
the unbiased views of others and in admitting one‘s ownlimitations and
failures. According to Peter Drucker, purpose of thebusiness is not to make a
sale, but to make and keep a customer.
 Enumerate the importance of listening in empathy( 7 marks)
ASSOCIATION BETWEEN LISTENING & EMPATHY

 Listening and empathy are the two important factors to build up a strong and
worthy relationship, based on the mutual exchange of views and ideas. The
proper listening enables a person to have the accurate assessment of the
conditions, situations and status of other persons for the proper future-orientated
actions. Learning also provides more clues to the person to identify the feelings of
others for mutual help.

Page 51 of 58

 The ultimate benefits of the association between listening and empathy are
explained as follows:
 1.It provides a green signal to the other persons about the meaningful perception
of a message and for further closed dialogues.
 2.This erodes and also corrects any misconception or misunderstanding between
the individuals there by creating transparent understanding of others
 3.This interaction promotes and improves the quality of personal
conversation between individuals regarding some sensitive andemotional topics.
 4. This interaction strengthens the bond of friendship thus ensuring forfurther
intimate exchange of personal views.
 5. This interaction contributes certain good qualities and virtues such asmutual
help, forgiveness and tolerance.
 The ideal combination of both empathy and sympathy constitutes the
important aspect of ethical code of conduct and character. This unique
combination of a character is expressed, when a person remains in a state of
calamity due to various personal and social causes. For example, when an
individual is grieved by the death of his family member, the gentle expression of
condolences by uttering a few soothing words with the sharing of his sorrowful
feelings would provide a sense of consolation and comfort to the bereaved
individual. It is the real essence of human values that the persons who are affected
by any natural or personal calamity, should be attended with the deep sense of
affectionand dedication.
 Define Self Confidence.( 3marks)

SELF-CONFIDENCE

 The term self-confidence refers to the positive attitude to face and execute
anything with capability. Self-confidence is identified as an important moral
virtue that strengthens the mental stability and will power for the successful
achievement of any task. It acts as a morale booster to motivate a person in a right
direction. It provides a person withself-courage and self-interest to think and act in

a constructive terms. The basic attitude of optimism and selfless efforts would
provide a striking force to a person for the perfect execution of any task.
 Certainty in one‘s own capabilities, values, and goals, is self-confidence. Such
people are usually positive thinking, flexible and willing to change. They respect
others so much as they respect themselves. Self-confidence is positive attitude,
wherein the individual has some positive and realistic view of himself, with respect
to the situations in which one gets involved.
 The people with self- confidence exhibit courage to get into action and
unshakable faith in their abilities, whatever may be their positions. They are not
influenced by threats or challenges and are prepared to face themand the natural or
unexpected consequences. The self-confidence in a person develops a sense of
partnership, respect, and accountability, and this helps the organization to obtain
maximum ideas, efforts, and guidelines from its employees.

The following methodologies are effective in developing self-
confidence in a person:

 Encouraging SWOT analysis. By evaluating their strength and
weakness, they can anticipate and be prepared to face the results.
 Training to evaluate risks and face them (self-acceptance).
 Self-talk . It is conditioning the mind for preparing the self to act, withoutany doubt
on his capabilities. This make one accepts himself while still striving for
improvement.
 Study and group discussion, on the history of leaders and innovators (e.g., Sam
Walton of Wal-Mart, USA).

examples
 I have the potential ability of doing any task.
 I have the better exposure and capability of handling and doing anyactivity.
 I have the professional competence of executing that task.
 I have the personal integrity and honesty in my professional approach.
 Proper evaluation and assessment of one’s capability and potential
strength.
 I have a transparent and modest character to avoid the balancing byothers.
 I have a better sense of mind to appreciate the nature of work done byothers.
 Write a short note on social expectations (7 marks)
SOCIAL EXPECTATIONS

 Social expectations are ideas that we have of how someone in our social
surroundings will behave in the future or in a specific situation. When we
generate an impression of someone, these expectations are associated with the
image we generate. This helps us imagine how we have to behave or act around
them and to predict their behavior.
 This conduct of generating expectations about our relationships fulfills an

Page 55 of 58

adaptive function. It’s pretty simple to guess what it is. In an artificialenvironment,
based on complex societies such as the ones most of us inhabit, foreseeing the
behavior of others allows us to adapt our own behavior. Thus, we would greatly
benefit in social interactions. Despite that this isn’t a precise process, making a
prediction and being wrong at times is better than not doing it or never guessing
correctly.
 It’s important to know that these social or behavioral expectations greatly
influence our own behavior. We don’t treat everyone alike, just as we don’t treat
the same person the same way in every situation. We can see this in many
everyday situations. Plus, we try to make others meet our expectations, either by
forcing them indirectly or altering our perception them. This process takes place in
both directions. We are also aware of the expectations others have of us. So we
also attempt to adaptour behavior in order to satisfy these ideas.

Define Globalization.(3)

GLOBALIZATION

Globalization means integration of countries through
commerce, transfer of technology, and exchange of information and culture. In a
way, it includes acting together and interacting economies through trade,
investment, loan, development schemes and capital across countries. In a different
sense, these flows include knowledge, science, technology, skills, culture,
information, and entertainment, besides direct human resource, tele-work, and
outsourcing. This interdependence has increased the complex tensions and
ruptures among the nations. For the engineers, the issues such as multinational
organizations, computer, internet functions, military development and
environmental ethics have assumed greater importance for their very sustenance
and progress.
Globalization usually benefits the company and the home country by becoming more
competitive in world trade. Globalization offers many advantages for the developing
counties in the way of foreign investment, new increased employment opportunities
for their citizens, opportunities for skill development, transfer of new advanced
technology and management skills and many other social benefits due to the
improvement in their economy.
On the other hand it has many negative effects. It badly affects the job security and
employment generation in the home country. In globalisation there is a possibility of
protecting the economic interests of the home country than the host country and
exploiting natural resources and labour. Many occasions the affects the cultural
diversity of the host country. Thus globalization poses many questions related to

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 2 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

many issues connected with expanding operations to other countries. Some of them
are as follows:

 Whether globalization causes for job loss in the home country?
 Whether it causes for the exploitation of resources in the host
country?
 Whether it causes for the exploitation of labour in the host country?
 How the cultural diversities are addressed?
 What will be after effect of mixing of different cultures?
GLOBALIZATION OF ENGINEERING

As more and more companies expand their operations in an international manner, the
engineer‘s professional life may come across with many physical, cultural and
political environments those belong to different countries.International trade
agreements and consideration towards international laws governing human rights
and environmental issues make the decision making process very complicate with
regard to personal and professional life. Such considerations raise new moral and
ethical questions that are relevant to engineers with regard to their profession. As
professionals, engineers are bound to follow some ethical codes so as to comply with
their obligations towards the wellbeing of the society and people where they work.

GLOBALIZATION & ENGINEERING EDUCATION

As part of this phenomena, engineering also became global. The first step in the
globalization of engineering is establishing universal criteria for engineering
education .There are many accords in the world with regard to engineering
education. India is a member country in the Washington Accord. It is an agreement
among bodies that have the authority to accredit engineering programs in their
respective countries or jurisdictions? The primary purpose of the accord is to
establish substantial agreement among the signatory countries or jurisdictions are
able to accept the qualifications of engineers graduating from accredited institutions
in other signatory countries or jurisdictions as equivalent. The engineers in the
accredited jurisdictions are expected not only to meet minimal technical standards in
their education but also to abide some code of conduct.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES
ENGINEERS AS PROFESSIONALS

Generally, engineers are considered as professionals. As professionals they are
bound to follow some ethical codes that guide themselves so as to comply with their
responsibilities towards the wellbeing of the people and the sustainability of the
environment. There are several accredited associations for engineers such as
National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE), Commonwealth Engineers
Council (CEC) The World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO).All
these organizations promote ethics and professional conduct and endorses the
obligation of engineers to promote health, safety and welfare of the
public.Asprofessionals, engineers are bound to abide the code of professional ethics
applicable internationally and nationally related to multiple nations with regard to
their functional area. Hence the awareness and compliance of these diverging ethical
conditions are very important for their sustenance and progress of multinational
corporations.
Define Multinational Companies.(3)

MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS

Organisations who have established business in more than one country, are called
Multinational Corporation. The headquarters are in the home country and the
business is extended in many host countries. The Western organizations doing
business in the less-economically developed (developing, and overpopulated)
countries gain the advantage of inexpensive labour, availability of natural resources,
conducive-tax atmosphere, and virgin market for the products. At the same time, the
developing countries are also benefited by fresh job opportunities, jobs with higher
remuneration and challenges, transfer of technology, and several social benefits by
the wealth developed. But this happens invariably with some social and cultural
disturbance. Loss of jobs for the home country, and loss or exploitation of natural
resources, political instability for the host countries are some of the threats of
globalization.
A multinational corporation is known by various names such as: global
enterprise, international enterprise, world enterprise, transnational
corporation etc.

Features of Multinational Corporations (MNCs)

Following are the salient features of MNCs:
(i) Huge Assets andTurnover:Because of operations on a global basis,
MNCs have huge physical and financial assets. This also results in huge
turnover (sales) of MNCs. In fact, in terms of assets and turnover, many
MNCs are bigger than national economies of several countries.
(ii)InternationalOperationsthroughaNetworkofBranches:MNCs have production
and marketing operations in several countries; operating through a network of
branches, subsidiaries and affiliates in host countries.

economicentities.Theykeeponaddingtotheireconomicpower through constant
mergers and acquisitions of companies, in hostcountries.
(v)Advanced and Sophisticated Technology: Generally, a MNC has at its
command advanced and sophisticated technology. It employs capital intensive
technology in manufacturing and marketing.
(vi)ProfessionalManagement: A MNC employs professionally trained managers to
handle huge funds, advanced technology and international business operations.
(vii)Aggressive Advertising andMarketing:MNCs spend huge sums of money on
advertising and marketing to secure international business. This is, perhaps, the
biggest strategy of success of MNCs. Because of this strategy, they are able to sell
whatever products/services, they produce/generate.
(viii)Better Quality of Products:A MNC has to compete on the world level. It,
therefore, has to pay special attention to the quality of its products.

Describe the merits & demerits of MNCS from the view point of
host country.(14)

ADVANTAGES &LIMITATIONS OF MNCS
Advantages of MNCs from the Viewpoint of Host Country

We propose to examine the advantages and limitations of MNCs from the
viewpoint of the host country. In fact, advantages of MNCs make for the case in
favour of MNCs; while limitations of MNCs become the case against MNCs.
(i) EmploymentGeneration:MNCs create large scale employment
opportunities in host countries. This is a big advantage of MNCs for
countries; where there is a lot of unemployment.
(ii) Automatic Inflow of ForeignCapital:MNCs bring in much needed
capital for the rapid development of developing countries. In fact, with
the entry of MNCs, inflow of foreign capital is automatic. As

knowledge, MNCs are in a position to properly utilize idle physical and
human resources of the host country. This results in an increase in the
National Income of the host country.
(iv) ImprovementinBalanceofPaymentPosition:MNCs help the host
countries to increase their exports. As such, they help the host country to
improve upon its Balance of Payment position.
(v).TechnicalDevelopment: MNCs carry the advantages of technical development 10
host countries. In fact, MNCs are a vehicle for transference of technical
development from one country to another. Because of MNCs poor host countries
also begin to develop technically.
(vi) ManagerialDevelopment: MNCs employ latest management techniques.
People employed by MNCs do a lot

ong latest lines of management theory and practice. This leads to
managerial development in hostcountries.
(vii) End of LocalMonopolies: The entry of MNCs leads to competition in
the host countries. Local monopolies of host countries either start
improving their products or reduce their prices. Thus MNCs put an end to
exploitative practices of local monopolists. As a matter of fact, MNCs
compel domestic companies to improve their efficiency and quality.

MNCs promote international brotherhood and culture; and pave way for world
peace and prosperity.

Limitations of MNCs from the Viewpoint of Host Country
(i)Danger for DomesticIndustries:MNCs, because of their vast economic
power, pose a danger to domestic industries; which are still in the process of
development. Domestic industries cannot face challenges posed by MNCs.
Many domestic industries have to wind up, as a result of threat from MNCs.
Thus MNCs give a setback to the economic growth of host countries.
(ii)Repatriation ofProfits:(Repatriation of profits means sending profits
to their country):MNCs earn huge profits. Repatriation of profits by MNCs
adversely affects the foreign exchange reserves of the host country; which
means that a large amount of foreign exchange goes out of the host country.
(iii)No Benefit to PoorPeople:MNCs produce only those things, which
are used by the rich. Therefore, poor people of host countries do not get,
generally, any benefit, out of MNCs.
(iv)Danger to Independence: Initially MNCs help the Government of the
host country, in a number of ways; and then gradually start interfering in the
political affairs of the host country. There is, then, an implicit danger to the
independence of the host country, in the long-run.
(v)DisregardoftheNationalInterestsoftheHostCountry:MNCs invest in
most profitable sectors; and disregard the national goals and priorities of the
host country. They do not care for the development of backward regions;
and never care to solve chronic problems of the host country like
unemployment and poverty.
(vi)Misuse of

they have ended local competitionand achieved monopoly. This
may be the dirty strategy of MNCs to wipe off local competitors
from the host country.

use the natural resources of the host country carelessly. They cause

rapid depletion of some of the non-renewable natural resources of
the host country. In this way, MNCs cause a permanent damage to
the economic development of the host country.
(vii)Selfish Promotion of AlienCulture:

e.g. MNCs have created a taste for synthetic food, soft drinks etc.
This promotion of foreign culture by MNCs is injurious to the
health of peoplealso.
(viii)ExploitationofPeople,inaSystematicManner: MNCs join
hands with big business houses of host country and emerge as
powerful monopolies. This leads to concentration of economic
power only in a few hands. Gradually these monopolies make it
their birth right to exploit poor people and enrich themselves at the
cost of the poor working class.
MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN INDIA

MNCs have been operating in India even prior to Independence, like Singer,
Parry, Philips, Unit- Lever, Proctor and Gamble. They either operated in the form
of subsidiaries or entered into collaboration with Indian companies involving sale
of technology as well as use of foreign brand names for the final products. The
entry of MNCs in India was controlled by existing industrial policy statements,

New Industrial Policy 1991 and Multinational Corporations
The New Industrial Policy 1991, removed the restrictions of entry to
MNCs through various concessions. The amendment of FERA in 1993
provided further concession to MNCs in India.
At present MNCs in India can—

(vi) Deal in immovable properties inIndia.
(vii) Carry on in India any activity of trading, commercial or industrial
except a very small negativelist.
Thus, MNCs have been placed at par with Indian Companies and would
not be subjected to any special restrictions under FERA.
CRITICISMS AGAINST MNCS IN INDIA

The operations of MNCs in India have been opposed on the
followinggrounds:
(i) They are interested more on mergers and acquisitions and not on freshprojects.
(ii) They have raised very large part of their financial resources from
within the country.
(iii) They supply second hand plant and machinery declared obsolete in
their country.
(i v) They are mainly profit oriented and have short term focus on quick
profits. National interests and problems are generally ignored.
(v) They use expatriate management and personnel rather than
competitive Indian Management.
(vi) Though they collect most of the capital from within the country, they
have repatriated huge profits to their mothercountry.
(vii) They make no effort to adopt an appropriate technology suitable to
the needs. Moreover, transfer of technology proves verycostly.
(viii) Once an MNC gains foothold in a venture, it tries to increase its
holding in order to become a majorityshareholder.

INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS

To know what are the moral responsibilities and obligations of the
multinational corporations operating in the host countries, let us discuss with
the framework of rights ethics. Common minimal rights are to be followed to
smoothen the transactions when the engineers and employers of MNCs have to
interact at official, social, economic and sometimes political levels. At
international level, the organizations are expected to adopt the minimum levels
of
• (a) values, such as mutual support, loyalty, and reciprocity,
• (b) the negative duty of refraining from harmful actions such as violence and
fraud, and
• (c) basic fairness and practical justice in case of conflicts.
The ten international rights to be taken care of, in this context are:
• 1. Right of freedom of physical movement of people
• 2. Right of ownership of properties
• 3. Freedom from torture
• 4. Right to fair trial on the products
• 5. Freedom from discrimination on the basis of race or sex. If such
discrimination against women or minorities is prevalent in the host country, the
MNC will be compelled to accept. MNCs may opt to quit that country if the
human rights violations are severe.
• 6. Physical security. Use of safety gadgets have to be supplied to the workers
even if the laws of the host country do not suggest such measures.
• 7. Freedom of speech and forming association
• 8. Right to have a minimum education
• 9. Right to political participation

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 11 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• 10. Right to live and exist (i.e., coexistence). The individual liberty and sanctity
of the human life are to be respected by all societies.
Evaluate the technology transfer & appropriate technology.
(8)

TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

It is a process of moving technology to a new setting and implementing it there.
Technology includes hardware (machines and installations) and the techniques
(technical, organizational, and managerial skills and procedures). It may mean
moving the technology applications from laboratory to the field/factory or from
one country to another. This transfer is effected by governments, organizations,
universities, and MNCs. Thus there happens a transfer or movement of
technology and associated skills from one country to another that finally
improves the development process of the host country.
For example, when a developing country permits a foreign country to
manufacture a particular model of aircraft to host country, the MOU between
the countries provides for the technology transfer after a particular period or
certain number of production units into the host country. Here the parent
company trains the local people to handle the technology and associate them in
production process. After the specified period the parent company transfers the
technology (both machines and installations and the operating and managing
skills) to the host country. Thereafter the host company can be able to produce
that model of aircraft freely.

USE OF APPROPRIATE TECHNOLOGY

The MNCs are expected to identify,transfer, and implement the appropriate
technology matching to the new situations .Technology includes both hardware
and software that includes technical, organizational and managerial skills and
procedures. Many factors like economic, social and engineering have
determinant role in choosing and implementing appropriate technology.
Availability and nature of resources, physical conditions, capital opportunity
costs and the human value system that includes traditions, beliefs, religion, also
influence the decision about the right kind of technology.

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 12 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

For example, the interest of small farmers in our country with regard to use of
power tillers rather than high-powered tractors or sophisticated harvesting
machines and the social security job conditions are to be considered while
thinking about importing a new technology for the appropriateness. The term
appropriate is value based and it should ensure fulfilment of the human needs
and protection of the environment.
RESPECTING CULTURAL DIFFERNECES & CULTURAL

RELATIVISM

One of the toughest area of ethical concern is the accommodation of different
cultures with the business domain. Every time an MNC expands its operation
to a host country it has to address a new culture that is different from home
country. Then the question is whether the company follows the adage ―When in
Rome, do as the Romans‖. Different cultures have different moral norms and
practices. The actions of corporation and individuals that are accepted by law,
custom and other values of a society can be morally right in that society. But it
may not be acceptable to another society by custom, values, and even law. This
situation is known as Cultural Relativism.
When multinational companies assume that their moral values depend on the
culture in which they operate, they practice ethical relativism. Ethical
relativisms means morality is relative. That is, these companies apply different
ethical and moral standards according to the physical locations of their
operations .It means the corporation and the engineers functioning inn other
countries must understand their law ,customs and beliefs and act in line with
those prevailing in that country.
If the organizations practice laws of the home country, without any changes or
adjustments to the host country it referred to ethical absolutism.This style is
also problematic irrespective of the goodness is something relational. Hence,
the way out for MNCs to overcome the situation is to follow ethical rationalism
that matches with the context, as a compromise.Every moral judgement has to
be made in relation to the prevailing factors locally,without sticking on rigid

rules.Then the moral decisions will, be realistic, matching with the context,
culture and customs of other countries.

Explain the tree guide lines that business person should
follow while doing business in other countries?(6)
The three guide lines that keep you on the right path when doing business

in other countries

1. Adhere to Universal moral standards: The first obligation of any
multinational company is to follow universal moral standards.Although the
culture of people of different places differ in determiningwhat constitutes for
right and wrong, there are some universal moral views those are shared in
common. For example committing murder without substantial reason is
considered as wrong everywhere .But all societies consider that killing another
person without substantial reason or committing a rape or bribery is a crime
and prohibits such acts through laws. Moral standards include prohibitions
against stealing, obligations to care for children and the elderly, avoidance of
exploitation of natural resources etc.
2. Keep trust and honesty as basic principles:MNCs should comply with
certain level of trust and honesty. Trust is an essential ingredient for any
business enterprise to survive in a long term basis. In any transaction whether it
is providing goods or services as suppliers or purchasing materials as
manufacturers or paying the employees, enterprises should keep trust worthy
dealings. The employers should provide fair pay, safety measures to the
employees and develop trust among the employees towards the organization.
We can nurture trust through honest dealings as honesty acts as moral currency
of business.
3. Value Human Rights: Multinational business should respect human
liberties. So ethical companies take the responsibility to defend and promote
human rights of the people in the home country as well as the host countries.
Thus the task of multinational businesses is to address and respect the cultural
differences of people and nations and adhering to the universal ethical norms.

Define Environmental ethics.(3)

ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS

There exists a direct co-relation between the living organisms and the surrounding
environment. The dynamic survival of all living organisms including man, is much
dependent on the environmental factors such as composition (if atmospheric air,
temperature, light and soil texture. When these ecological factors are influenced by
an external agent such as air or water or soil pollution, the ecological imbalance
appears. This in turn, drastically alters and affects human population and other living
organisms in the biosphere. These factors form the fundamental basis for the
introduction and implementation of a modern concept called "environmental
ethics".
Environmental Ethics deal with issues related to the rights of individuals that are
fundamentaltolifeandwell-being. Theseconcernnotonlytheneedsofeachperson
today, but also those who will come after us. It also deals with the rights of others

contributing their best efforts to keep the environment clean. While taking up any
challenging careers, engineers should evaluate to what extent their professional
assignments would directly interfere with and harm the surrounding environment.
They must have the insights in designing and formulating their productive plans
which will not either crucially led to the environmental degradation or
deterioration.Engineersneedtoshowsomeresponsibilitytowardstheenvironmentandsho
uldbe ethical in their approach and find mitigating solutions for the protection of
environment. Hence engineers in the past were not bothered about the degradation of
environment, in their activities .Presently most of the activities associated with engineering are
governed by several legislations related to environmental considerations.Now engineers are
bound to follow many code of conducts, eco-friendly tools, machines processes and projects
which ensures environmental diversity.These include measures such as
1.Ensure protection of environment
2. Prevent the degradation of environment
3.Slowdown the exploitation of the natural resources, so that future
generations can also survive in this planet.
The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) code of ethics has specifically requires
that engineers shall hold paramount the safety ,health and welfare of the public and shall
strive to comply with the principles of sustainable development in the performance of
professional duties .The term sustainable development emphasizes on the investment
,orientation of technology ,development and functioning of organizations without denying
the present needs of people and ensuring for the future generations also to meet their needs.
Engineers, by virtue of their responsibility as professionals, are expected to follow
some ethical principles irrespective of whether there are legal obligations or not
1. Impact assessment on environment and human wealth: One of the major effect of
technology is the creation of wastage that results in pollution of land, water, air and even
space. Detailed study is necessary to assess the extent of negative impacts of implementing
new technology on environment and human health.

2. Establish standards/acceptable level pollution: Study and to fix the tolerable and
actual pollution levels.In some cases such ashazardous pollutants the recommended
approach is to access the cost benefit in deciding the permissible level of pollution .But
CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis) should be based on maximizing human well-being. But in
some other cases cost is not relevant in fixing the level of pollution such as water pollution.
The resource Conservation and Recovery Act of USA requires that standards regulating
hazardouswaste be based solely on the protection of public health and the environment.
3.Countermeasures: Engineers should study on the available alternatives to
reduce/eliminate the bad effects of technology or the measures to protect from the bad
effects.
4.Environmnetalawareness:Many of the problems associated with technology and
engineering can be avoided /reduced by taking precautions .Proper steps to educate people
on the environmental issues ,practices and remedies can solve the problems effectively.

This view is guiding most industrial societies. It puts human beings in the
center giving them the highest status. Man is considered to be most
capable for managing the planet earth.
The guiding principles of this view are:
1. Man is the planet‘s most important species and is in the in- charge of

world? (14)

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES

• 1. ACID RAIN: In most of the countries across the world, acid rain has
become the serious environmental problem due to intensive advancements in
industrializations. The continuous burning of fossil fuels such as petroleum
products (automobile exhaust) are identified as the maximum contributors as
the causative agents for acid rain. The above-said factors continuously release
abundant concentrations of nitrogen and sulphur oxides (NO2 and SO2) into the
atmosphere. These oxides react with moisture to form sulphuric acid and nitric
acid (HNO3 and H2SO4). These acids, when descending down to earth along
with rain water, produce corrosive reactions on animals, green plants and all
dwelling buildings.
2. PRESENCE OF ASBESTOS IN ATMOSPHERIC AIR AND DRINKING
WATER: In 1955, an ore processing mining company commenced its huge plant
to produce an iron ore called taconite at Silver Bay, Minnesota, USA. The nearby,
Lake Superior was heavily polluted with taconite contamination, due to the
continuous discharge of the effluent from the plant. The taconite contamination
eventually led to the drastic depletion of O2 in that aquatic system and had further
resulted in the massive killing of fishes. Moreover, asbestos-like fibers were found
to have heavily infiltrated into the drinking-water supplies from Lake Superior,
thus causing serious water contamination. The Federal government of Minnesota
State filed legal dispute in the court of law and the Reserves taconite plant was
finally directed to shift over to another disposed land site.
3. PLASTIC WASTE DISPOSAL:In our country, several crores of plastic bottles
are used as containers for water and oil, and plastic bags are used to pack different
materials ranging from vegetables to gold ornaments. Hardly any of these are
recycled. They end up in gutters, roadsides, and agricultural fields. In all these
destinations, they created havoc. The worse still is the burning of plastic materials
in streets and camphor along with plastic cover in temples, since they release toxic

fumes and threaten seriously the air quality. Cities and local administration have to
act on this, collect and arrange for recycling through industries.
• 4.e-WASTE DISPOSAL: The parts of computers and electronic devices
which have served its useful life present a major environmental issue for all the
developing countries including India. This scrap contains highly toxic elements
such as lead, cadmium, and mercury. Even the radioactive waste will lose 89% of
its toxicity after 200 years, by which time it will be no more toxic than some
natural minerals in the ground. It will lose 99% of its remaining toxicity over the
next 30,000 years. The toxic chemical agents such as mercury, arsenic, and
cadmium retain toxicity undiminished for ever. But these scraps are illegally
imported by unscrupulous agencies to salvage some commercially valuable
inputs. Instead of spending and managing on the scrap, unethical organizations
sell them to countries such as India. This is strictly in violation of the Basel
Convention of the United Nations Environment Program, which has banned the
movement of hazardous waste.
• A recent report of the British Environment Agency, has revealed that the
discarded computers, television sets, refrigerators, mobile phones, and
electrical equipments have been dispatched to India and Pakistan in large
quantity, for ultimate disposal in environmentally-unacceptable ways and at
great risk to the health of the labour. Even in the West, the electronic junk has
been posing problems.
• Strong regulation including
• (a)pressure on industries to set up disassembling facilities,
• (b) ban on disposal in landfill sites,
• (c) legislation for recycling requirements for these junk and
• (d) policy incentives for eco-friendly design are essential for our country. The
European Union through the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
(WEEE) directive has curbed the e-waste dumping by member countries and

Page 21 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

require manufacturers to implement methods to recover and recycle the
components.
• 5.INDUSTRIAL WASTE DISPOSAL:There has been a lot of complaints
through the media, on
• (a) against the Sterlite Copper Smelting Plant in Thuthukkudi (1997) against
its pollution, and
• (b) when Indian companies imported the discarded French Warship
Clemenceau for disposal, the poisonous asbestos compounds were expected to
pollute the atmosphere besides exposing the labour to a great risk, during the
disposal. The government did not act immediately. Fortunately for Indians, the
French Government intervened and withdrew the ship, and the serious threat
was averted.
• 6.GLOBAL WARMING:Over the past 30 years, the Earth has warmed by 0.6
°C. Over the last 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 °C. It is likely to push up
temperature by 3° C by 2100, according to NASA‘s studies. The U.S.
administration has accepted the reality of global climate change, which has
been associated with stronger hurricanes, severe droughts, intense heat waves
and the melting of polar ice. Greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide emitted
by motor vehicles and coal-fired power plants, trap heat like the glass walls of
a greenhouse, cause the Earth to warm up. Delegates from the six countries —
Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and US met in California in April
2006 for the first working session of the Asia- Pacific Partnership on Clean
Development and Climate. These six countries account for about half of the
world‘s emissions of climate-heating greenhouse gases.
• Only one of the six, Japan, is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions
by at least 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012 under the Kyoto Agreement.
About 190 nations met in Germany in the middle of May 2006 and tried to
bridge vast policy gaps between the United States and its main allies over how
to combat climate change amid growing evidence that the world is warming

that could wreak havoc by stoking more droughts, heat waves, floods, more
powerful storms and raise global sea levels by almost a meter by 2100.
• 7.DEPLETION OF OZONE LAYER: The ozone layer protects the entire
planet from the ill-effects of ultraviolet radiation and is vital for all living
organisms in this world. But it is eaten away by the Chloro-fluro-carbons
(CFC) such as Freon emanating from the refrigerators, air conditioners, and
aerosol can spray. This has caused also skin cancer to sun-bathers in the
Western countries. Further NO and NO2 gases were also found to react with
the ozone. Apart from engineers, the organizations, laws of the country and
local administration and market mechanisms are required to take up concerted
efforts to protect the environment.
What is Business Ethics. (3)

BUSINESS ETHICS

• The term  ̳Business Ethics‘ refers to the system of moral principles and rules of
the conduct applied to business. Business being a social organ shall not be
conducted in a way detrimental to the interests of the society and the business
sector itself. Every profession or group frames certain do‘s and do not‘s for its
members. The members are given a standard in which they are supposed to
operate. These standards are influenced by the prevailing economic and social
situations. The codes of conduct are periodically reviewed to suit the changing
circumstances.

DEFINITIONS: BUSINESS ETHICS

• Business Ethics is generally coming to know what is right or wrong in the work
place and doing what is right. This is in regard to effects of products/services
and in relationship with the stake holders.‖ —Cater Mcnamara
• ―Business ethics in short can be defined as the systematic study of ethical
matters pertaining to the business, industry or related activities, institutions and

Page 23 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

beliefs. Business ethics is the systematic handling of values in business and
industry.‖ — John Donaldson
• There is no unanimity of opinion as to what constitutes business ethics. There
are no separate ethics of business but every individual and organ in society
should abide by certain moral orders.
• Business ethics should take into consideration the following factors:
• A business should aim to have fair dealing with everyone dealing with it.
• Ethics should be fixed for everyone working in the organisation at any level
and their implementation should be linked with reward- punishment system.
• Any violation of ethics should be detected at the earliest and remedial measures
taken immediately.
• Business ethics should be based on broad guidelines of what should be done
and what should be avoided.
• The ethics should be based on the perception of what is right.
What are the sources of business ethics? (6)
SOURCES OF BUSINESS ETHICS

• In every society there are three sources of business ethics-Religion, Culture and
Law. The HR manager in every organisation, thus, has to be well versed with
the unique system of values developed by these three sources.
• These sources are discussed as follows:
• 1. Religion: Religion is the oldest source of Religion is the oldest source of
ethical inspiration. There are more than ethical inspirations. 1, 00,000 religions
which exist across the whole world, but all of them are in agreement on the
fundamental principles. Every religion gives an expression of what is wrong
and right in business and other walks of life. The Principle of reciprocity
towards one‘s fellow beings is found in all the religions.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• Great religions preach the necessity for an orderly social system and emphasize
upon social responsibility with an objective to contribute to the general welfare.
With these fundamentals, every religion creates its own code of conduct.
2.Culture:Culture is the set of important understandings that members of a
community share in common. It consists of a basic set of values, ideas, perceptions,
preferences, concept of morality, code of conduct etc. which creates distinctiveness
among human groups. When we talk about culture we typically refer to the pattern of
development reflected in a society‘s pattern of knowledge, ideology, values, laws,
social norms and day to day rituals. Depending upon the pattern and stage of
development, culture differs from society to society. Moreover culture is passed from
generation to generation. Culture facilitates the generation of commitment to
something larger than one‘s individual self-interest.
• Culture encourages the members of the organisation to give priority to
organizational goals over and above their personal interests. Culture also serves
as a sense making and control mechanism that guides and shapes the attitudes
and behaviour of people. Managers have to run an industrial enterprise on the
cutting edge of cultural experience. The tension that their actions create makes
the business ethically more complex.
• 3.Law: The legal system of any country, guide the human behaviour in the
society. Whatever, ethics the law defines are binding on the society? The
society expects the business to abide by the law. Although it is expected that
every business should be law abiding, seldom do the businesses adhere to the
rules and regulations. Law breaking in business is common eg. Tax evasion,
hoarding, adulteration, poor quality & high priced products, environment
pollution etc.

State the importance of business ethics. (7)
IMPORTANCE OF BUSINESS ETHICS

• 1.Corresponds to Basic Human Needs: The basic need of every human being
is that they want to be a part of the organisation which they can respect and be
proud of, because they perceive it to be ethical. Everybody likes to be
associated with an organisation which the society respects as a honest and
socially responsible organisation. The HR managers have to fulfill this basic
need of the employees as well as their own basic need that they want to direct
an ethical organisation. The basic needs of the employees as well as the
managers compel the organizations to be ethically oriented.
• 2.Credibility in the Public: Ethical values of an organisation create credibility
in the public eye. People will like to buy the product of a company if they
believe that the company is honest and is offering value for money. The public
issues of such companies are bound to be a success. Because of this reason
only the cola companies are spending huge sums of money on the
advertisements now-a-days to convince the public that their products are safe
and free from pesticides of any kind.
• 3.Credibility with the Employees: When employees are convinced of the
ethical values of the organisation they are working for, they hold the
organisation in high esteem. It creates common goals, values and language. The
HR manager will have credibility with the employees just because the
organisation has creditability in the eyes of the public. Perceived social
uprightness and moral values can win the employees more than any other
incentive plans.
• 4.Better Decision Making:Respect for ethics will force a management to take
various economic, social and ethical aspects into consideration while taking the
decisions. Decision making will be better if the decisions are in the interest of
the public, employees and company‘s own long term good.

• 5.Profitability:Being ethical does not mean not making any profits. Every
organisation has a responsibility towards itself also i.e., to earn profits. Ethical
companies are bound to be successful and more profitable in the long run
though in the short run they can lose money.
• 6. Protection of Society: Ethics can protect the society in a better way than
even the legal system of the country. Where law fails, ethics always succeed.
The government cannot regulate all the activities that are harmful to the
society. A HR manager, who is ethically sound, can reach out to agitated
employees, more effectively than the police.
Describe the characteristics of business ethics?(7)

CHARACTERISTICS OF BUSINESS ETHICS
• To understand business ethics, it is necessary to know it‘s important
characteristics. These are:
• 1.A Discipline: Business ethics are the guiding principles of business function.
It is the knowledge through which human behaviour is learnt in a business
situation.
• 2.Ancient Concept: Business ethics is an ancient concept. It has it origin with
the development of human civilization.
• 3.PersonalDignity:The principles of ethics develop the personal dignity. Many
of the problems of ethics arise due to not giving dignity to individual. All the
business decisions should be aimed by giving dignity to the customers,
employees, distributors, shareholders and creditors, etc. otherwise they develop
in immorality in the business conducts.
• 4.Related to Human Aspect:Business ethics studies those activities, decisions
and behaviors which are concerned with human aspect. It is the function of the
business ethics to notify those decisions to customers, owners of business,

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 27 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

government, society, competitors and others on good or bad, proper or
improper conduct of business.
• 5.Study of Goals and Means: Business ethics is the study of goals and means
for the rational selection of sacred objects and their fulfillment. It accepts the
principles of ―Pure goals inspire for pure means‖ and ―Means justifies the end‖.
It is essential that goals and means should be based on morals.
• 6.Different from Social Responsibility: Social responsibility mainly relates
to the policies and functions of an enterprise, whereas business ethics to the
conduct and behaviour of businessmen. But it is a fact that social responsibility
of business and its policies is influenced by the business ethics.
• 7.Greater than Law: Although the law approves various social decisions, but
the law is not greater than ethics. Law is usually related to the minimum
control of social customs whereas ethics gives importance to individual and
social welfare actions.
Define Computer Ethics.(3)

COMPUTER ETHICS

• The advent of computer and its vast applications are the fantastic outcome of
the scientific and technological advancements. The unmeasurable utility value
of the computers, have made a dramatic impact on business activities
throughout the world. Computers have become the most essential operative
tools in all the modern spheres of life such as engineering systems, scientific
research studies, business and marketing activities. It is unfortunate to state that
computer applications are wrongly exploited and misused for various
unethical purposes thereby creating serious law and order implications in the
human societies across the world. The unlawful and defrauding uses of
computer applications constitute fundamental basis for the creation of true
awareness on computer ethics.

• The term computer ethics refers to a specialized branch of engineering ethics
to be adopted by the computer professionals and engineers to prevent the
misuse and abuse of computer applications thereby maintaining secrecy and
the moral confidence of the users. Computer ethics is defined as
• (a) study and analysis of nature and social impact of computer technology,
• (b) formulation and justification of policies, for ethical use of computers. This
subject has become relevant to the professionals such as designers of
computers, programmers, system analysts, system managers, and operators.
• The use of computers have raised a host of moral concerns such as free speech,
privacy, intellectual property right, and physical as well as mental harm. There
appears to be no conceptual framework available on ethics, to study and
understand and resolve the problems in computer technology.Computers with
Internet raise a host of difficult moral issues, many of them connected with
basic moral concerns such as free speech, privacy, respect for property,
informed consent and harm. To evaluate and deal with these issues, a new area
of applied ethics called Computer Ethics has come up. These ethics are related
to all the computer professionals such as programmers, analysts, operators,
designers, etc. along with the users.
Explain the major types of issues in computer ethics?(7)
Discuss in detail about moral & ethical issues involved in
the use of computers and internet with examples? (14)

TYPES OF ISSUES

• 1. Computer as the Instrument of Unethical Acts:(a) The usage of computer
replaces the job positions. This has been overcome to a large extent by
readjusting work assignments, and training everyone on computer applications
such as word processing, editing, and graphics.

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• (b) Breaking privacy. Information or data of the individuals accessed or erased
or the ownership changed.
• (c) Defraud a bank or a client, by accessing and withdrawing money from
other‘s bank account.
• 2. Computer as the Object of Unethical Act:The data are accessed and
deleted or changed.
• a) Hacking: The software is stolen or information is accessed from other
computers. This may cause financial loss to the business or violation of privacy
rights of the individuals or business. In case of defense information being
hacked, this may endanger the security of the nation.
• (b) Spreading virus: Through mail or otherwise, other computers are accessed
and the files are erased or contents changed altogether.  ̳Trojan horses‘ are
implanted to distort the messages and files beyond recovery. This again causes
financial loss or mental torture to the individuals. Some hackers feel that they
have justified their right of free information or they do it for fun. However,
these acts are certainly unethical.
• (c)Health hazard: The computers pose threat during their use as well as during
disposal.
• 3. Problems Related to the Autonomous Nature of Computer :(a) Security
risk:Recently the Tokyo Stock Exchange faced a major embarrassment. A
seemingly casual mistake by a junior trader of a large security house led to
huge losses including that of reputation. The order through the exchange‘s
trading system was to sell one share for 600,000 Yen. Instead the trader keyed
in a sale order for 600,000 shares at the rate of one Yen each. Naturally the
shares on offer at the ridiculously low price were lapped up. And only a few
buyers agreed to reverse the deal! The loss to the securities firm was said to be
huge, running into several hundred thousands. More important to note, such an
obvious mistake could not be corrected by some of the advanced technology

available. For advanced countries like Japan who have imbibed the latest
technology, this would be a new kind of learning experience.
• b) Loss of human lives: Risk and loss of human lives lost by computer, in the
operational control of military weapons. There is a dangerous instability in
automated defense system. An unexpected error in the software or hardware or
a conflict during interfacing between the two, may trigger a serious attack and
cause irreparable human loss before the error is traced. The Chinese embassy
was bombed by U.S. military in Iraq a few years back, but enquiries revealed
that the building was shown in a previous map as the building where insurgents
stayed.
• (c) In flexible manufacturing systems, the autonomous computer is beneficial
in obtaining continuous monitoring and automatic control.
COMPUTERS IN WORKPLACE
The ethical problems initiated by computers in the workplace are:
• 1. Elimination of routine and manual jobs: This leads to unemployment, but
the creation of skilled and IT-enabled service jobs are more advantageous for
the people. Initially this may require some up gradation of their skills and
knowledge, but a formal training will set this problem right. For example, in
place of a typist, we have a programmer or an accountant.
• 2. Health and safety:The ill-effects due to electromagnetic radiation, especially
on women and pregnant employees, mental stress, wrist problem known as
Carpel Tunnel Syndrome, and back pain due to poor ergonomic seating
designs, and eye strain due to poor lighting and flickers in the display and long
exposure, have been reported worldwide. Over a period of long exposure, these
are expected to affect the health and safety of the people. The computer
designers should take care of these aspects and management should monitor the
health and safety of the computer personnel.

Page 31 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• 3. Computer failure:Failure in computers may be due to errors in the
hardware or software. Hardware errors are rare and they can be solved easily
and quickly. But software errors are very serious as they can stop the entire
network. Testing and quality systems for software have gained relevance and
importance in the recent past, to avoid or minimize these errors.

PROPERTY ISSUES
• The property issues concerned with the computers are:
• 1. Computers have been used to extort money through anonymous telephone
calls.
• 2. Computers are used to cheat and steal by current as well as previous
employees.
• 3. Cheating of and stealing from the customers and clients.
• 4. Violation of contracts on computer sales and services.
• 5. Conspiracy as a group, especially with the internet, to defraud the gullible,
stealing the identity and to forge documents.
• 6. Violation of property rights:Is the software a property? The software could
be either a Program (an algorithm, indicating the steps in solving a problem) or
a Source code (the algorithm in a general computer language such as
FORTAN, C and COBOL or an Object code (to translate the source code into
the machine language). How do we apply the concept of property here? This
demands a framework for ethical judgments.
• Property is what the laws permits and defines as can be owned, exchanged, and
used. The computer hardware (product) is protected by patents. The software
(idea, expression) is protected by copyrights and trade secrets. But algorithms
cannot be copyrighted, because the mathematical formulas can be discovered
but not owned. The object codes which are not intelligible to human beings
cannot be copyrighted. Thus, we see that reproducing multiple copies from one

copy of (licensed) software and distribution or sales are crimes. The open
source concepts have, to a great extent, liberalized and promoted the use of
computer programs for the betterment of society.
Describe the ethical features involved in computer crime?
(7)

COMPUTER CRIME

• The ethical features involved in computer crime are as follows:
• Physical Security: The computers are to be protected against theft, fire, and
physical damage. This can be achieved by proper insurance on the assets.
• 2. Logical security: The aspects related are
• (a) the privacy of the individuals or organizations,
• (b) confidentiality,
• (c)integrity, to ensure that the modification of data or program are done only by
the authorized persons,
• (d) uninterrupted service. This is achieved by installing appropriate
uninterrupted power supply or back-up provisions.
• (e) protection against hacking that causes dislocation or distortion. Licensed
anti-virus packages and firewalls are used by all computer users to ensure this
protection.
• Passwords and data encryption have been incorporated in the computer

software as security measures. But these have also been attacked and bye-
passed. But this problem is not been solved completely.

Major weaknesses in this direction are:
• (a) the difficulty in tracing the evidence involved and

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 33 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• (b)absence of stringent punishment against the crime. The origin of a threat to
the Central Government posted from an obscure browsing center, remained
unsolved for quite a long time. Many times, such crimes have been traced, but
there are no clear cyber laws to punish and deter the criminals.
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

• The computer professionals should be aware of different conflicts of interests
as they transact with other at different levels. The IEEE and Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) have established the codes of ethics to manage
such responsibilities.

COMPUTER ETHICAL CODES

• The ten commandments of Computer Ethics, created in 1992 by the Computer
Ethics Institute consists of the following −
One should never use a computer:

• To harm the people (anti-social activities)
• To interfere with other’s work (illegal manipulations)
• To snoop into other’s files (malware)
• To steal a computer/data (hacking)
• To bear false witness (manipulation and morphing)
• To use/ copy a software you didn’t pay for (like illegal
downloads and
• usages)
• To use or copy other’s software without compensations
(illegal pirated
• versions)

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 34 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES
• To use other’s intellectual output inappropriately (violating
IPR)
• Doing without thinking of social consequences of the program
being written (libeling)
• Always use a computer ensuring consideration and respect
towards fellow beings.

• An engineer who is responsible in developing a tool program is not entitled
to take that program, when he or she goes for a new job, without the direct
concurrence of the first employer.Computer system analysts must have the
moral commitment and accountability, when their programs develop errors
thereby affecting the safety and basic rights of the people.The engineers
working as project leaders should be obliged to have the necessary
corrections in the programs that might cause any injustice or property
damage to the customer or consumer.However, these ethics are facing lax in
today‘s world. A very small section of concerned individuals seems to be
following these ethics. A large section seems to be violating these ethics.
With this, there is an unprecedented increase in cybercrime.
Explain the role of computers in technological
development? (7)
ROLE OF COMPUTERS IN TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT
 In this section, we will discuss the role of Computers in Technological
Development. The limitations of Internet usage and free speech are to be
known clearly by every netizen. In this digital era, the morals expected from a
human being are the basic tools that control the unethical and sleazy manner of
handling the internet.Internet which is now a global network of networks,
initially used the infrastructure of the telephone system and is now being
handled by many telecommunication systems by wire, fiber or wireless
systems.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

 The Internet provides a spring of new ways to be in contact with other people
and with sources of information. It has also created greater convenience in
ordering consumer items, paying bills and social experiments trading stocks
and bonds. Like other major, it also has raised a host of new issues. One set of
issues centers on free speech, including control of obscene forms of
pornography, hate speech, spam which is unwanted commercial speech and
rebel. Computers contribute to greater centralization or decentralization insofar
as human decision makers direct them.
 There come issues which call for trouble wherein, computers are used in
embezzlement and other forms of stealing money or financial assets. The issues
concerning theft of software and information is again a similar one. The
computers are centrally involved when an unauthorized person uses a telephone
computer system to obtain private phone numbers or when maliciously alters or
scrambles the programming of a telephone computer. In today‘s world,
malicious people have come up with not one but various ways of exploiting
money, goods, services, assets, etc. through the computers and internet. The
Internet besides easing our work has also paved way to gather an individual‘s
confidential details easily.
 The two main factors that make computers troublesome are their speed and
geographical coverage, which allows the masses to be victimized further. The
difficulty lies in tracing the underlying transactions to apprehend the thieves.
This problem is compounded when the communication lines linking the
computers involved cross national boundaries.
 The most commonly discussed cases of computer abuse are instances such as
• The stealing or cheating by employees at work.
• The stealing by non-employees or former employees.
• The stealing from or cheating clients and consumers.
• The violation of contracts for computers sales or services.

• The many conspiracies to use computer networks to engage in
widespread fraud.

 Alarmingly, the Internet has led to an explosion of identity theft, in which
personal information is obtained and used to forge documents and commit
fraud.
Examine the privacy & anonymity related issues with
computer? (7)

PRIVACY & ANONYMITY

The data transmission and accessibility have improved tremendously by using
the computers, but the right to privacy has been threatened to a great extent.
Some issues concerned with the privacy are listed hereunder:
• 1. Records of Evidence: Service records or criminal records and the details of
people can be stored and accessed to prove the innocence or guilty. Records on
psychiatric treatment by medical practitioners or hospital, or records of
membership of organizations may sometime embarrass the persons in later
years.
• 2.Hacking:There are computer enthusiasts who wilfully or for fun, plant virus
or ―Trojan horses‖ that may fill the disc space, falsify information, erase files,
and even harm the hardware. They breakdown the functioning of computers
and can be treated as violation of property rights. Some hackers opine that the
information should be freely available for everybody. It is prudent that the right
to individual privacy in limiting the access to the information on oneself,
should not be violated. Further any unauthorized use of personal information
(which is a property), is to be considered as theft. Besides the individual
privacy, the national security, and freedom within the economy are to be
respected. The proprietary information and data of the organizations are to be
protected so that they can pursue the goals without hindrance.

Page 37 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• 3.Legal Response:In the Indian scene, the Right to Information Act 2005
provides the right to the citizens to secure access to information under the
control of public authorities, including the departments of the central
government, state governments, government bodies, public sector companies
and public sector banks, to promote transparency and accountability of public
authorities.
• 4. Anonymity: Anonymity in the computer communication has some merits as
well as demerits. While seeking medical or psychological counselling or
discussion (chat) on topics, such as AIDS, abortion, gay rights, the anonymity
offers protection (against revealing their identity). But frequently, anonymity is
misused by some people for money laundering, drug trafficking and preying
upon the vulnerable.
Examine the role of engineers as managers.(8)
ENGINEERS AS MANAGERS

• Engineers possess the inherent ability to provide proper leadership in guiding
the organizations and corporates for the achievement of successful prospects.
During their academic curriculum, the engineering graduates are moulded to
develop prospective responsibilities and career managements which are the
essential requirements to become efficient managers and administrators. They
are also imparted with orientation skills to cope with any abnormal situations in
their careers.
• An engineer, whether he works individually or works for a company, has to go
through some ethical issues, mostly under conditions such as, conceptualization
of a product, issues arising in design and testing departments, or may be on the
issues involving the manufacturing, sales and services. An Engineer is
responsible in promoting ethics in an organization, through framing
organizational policies, responsibilities and by personal attitudes and
obligations.Suppose, an issue occurs which might lead to a conflict, an

Page 38 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

engineer or say a professional should respond pertaining to specific morals and
professional ethics.
• An engineer should be able to work as a manager in such situations, resolving
conflicts according to priorities, keeping the organizational benefits in mind.
The issue must be resolved without hurting anyone‘s feelings and by
developing a mutual understanding with subtlety. Not only the engineers who
act as managers or the managers alone will share the responsibility, but there
lies some social responsibility to stakeholders, customers and employers of a
company. They act to develop wealth as well as the welfare of the society.
• Ethicists project the view that the manager‘s responsibility is only to increase
the profit of the organization, and only the engineers have the responsibility to
protect the safety, health, and welfare of the public. But the manager, though an
engineer or not, has the ethical responsibility to produce safe and good
products (or useful service), while showing respect for fellow human beings
including his employees, customers and the public. Hence, the objective for the
managers and engineers is to produce valuable products that are also profitable.
The characteristics of engineers as managers are:
• 1. Promote an ethical climate, through framing organization policies,
responsibilities and by personal attitudes and obligations.
• 2. Resolving conflicts, by evolving priority, developing mutual understanding,
generating various alternative solutions to problems.
• 3. Social responsibility to stakeholders, customers and employers. They act to
develop wealth as well as the welfare of the society. Ethicists project the view
that the manager‘s responsibility is only to increase the profit of the
organization, and only the engineers have the responsibility to protect the
safety, health, and welfare of the public. But managers have the ethical
responsibility to produce safe and good products (or useful service), while
showing respect for the human beings who include the employees, customers

and the public. Hence, the objective for the managers and engineers is to
produce valuable products that are also profitable.
• Engineers possess the technological skills and professional excellence by
which they transform themselves into sensitive area of managing the corporate
companies. Moreover, several local and multinational companies are quite
aware of the potential capabilities of engineers, whom they believe would
quickly understand the business techniques of any corporate body, than the
non-engineering graduates and their competent qualities in the finding of
suitable remedies for problems. Interestingly, graduate engineers become
convinced by the attractive offers of incentives and higher emoluments and
prestigious placement positions made by corporate companies.
Define Managing conflicts.(3)

MANAGING CONFLICTS

• It is the common feature that several corporate companies face crucial
problems with respect to the settlement of conflicts. These management
disputes and conflicts should be amicably settled and resolved by the
intervention of company managers who have been endowed with the
administrative skills and tactful decisions. Sometimes, managers should
exercise their commanding positions with enough force for the smooth
settlement of claims and conflicts.A conflict is a result of differences in
opinions. Conflicts generally arise where the work is shared among more than
one members. In fact, the situations of conflicts should be tolerated with
patience, understood impartially and resolved by the participation by all the
concerned.
When a project is distributed among a few members, the conflicts that
generally occur are :
• The schedule based conflicts might occur at different levels of execution of a
project, depending upon the priorities and limitations at each level.

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 40 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

• The prioritizing of projects or departments which can be arrived from end
requirements may change from time to time.
• The deficiency of personnel availability for certain project completion in due
time may also lead to a conflict.
• Conflicts that occur over technical, economic, and time factors such as cost,
time, and performance level.
• Conflict arising in administration such as
authority,responsibility, accountability, and logistics required.
• Conflicts of personality, human psychology and ego problems.
• Conflict over expenditure and its deviations.
• Picking out on the personnel creating may keep others away from the problem
and doesn‘t affect everyone. Such personnel can be trained again or given
precautions.
• The interest of the personnel doing a project should be focused on the ethical
attitudes and morals but not on their positions. In addition, the conflicts
between the personnel, can be solved by the manager who has more ways to
solve it. The evaluation of the results should be based on certain specified
objectives such as efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction.
MOST OF THE CONFLICTS CAN BE RESOLVED BY FOLLOWING
THE PRINCIPLES LISTED HERE:
• 1.People: Separate people from the problem. It implies that the views of all
concerned should be obtained. The questions such as what, why, and when the
error was committed is more important than to know who committed it.
• 2. Interests: Focus must be only on interest i.e., the ethical attitudes or motives
and not on the positions (i.e., stated views). A supplier may require commission
larger than usual prevailing rate for an agricultural product. But the past

analysis may tell us that the material is not cultivated regularly and the
monsoon poses some additional risk towards the supply. Mutual interests must
be respected to a maximum level. What is right is more important than who is
right!
• 3. Options: Generate various options as solutions to the problem so that there
is no time lag in decision making. This helps a manager to try the next best
solution should the first one fails.
• 4. Evaluation:The evaluation of the results should be based on some specified
objectives such as efficiency, quality, and customer satisfaction. More
important is that the means, not only the goals, should be ethical.
Discuss a) Consulting engineers. (6)

CONSULTING ENGINEERS

• The consulting engineers work in private. There is no salary from the
employers. But they charge fees from the sponsor and they have more freedom
to decide on their projects. Still they have no absolute freedom, because they
need to earn for their living.The consulting engineers differ from the salaried
engineers of an organization. These consulting engineers work in private and
are paid per advice they offer or for the service they provide in a field of
specialized knowledge or training. Consultants are individuals who typically
work for themselves but may also be associated with a consulting firm.
• Consultants can play a multi-faceted role; for example, they function as
advisors, fixers, bosses, generalists, stabilizers, listeners, advisors, specialists,
catalysts, managers or quasi-employees. Bringing in an expert can save time,
effort and money. It has been estimated that approximately 3/4 of all
companies call upon consultants at one time or another. Many companies claim
that they receive a higher return for their invested dollars by using consultants
for specific tasks.A Consulting Engineer should maintain the ethical values in
the profession, such as giving proper information without any ambiguities for

advertisements, the allowance of small individual companies to participate in
bidding and also maintaining clarity in the contingency fee which is previously
agreed. The greater amount of job freedom enjoyed by consulting engineers as
opposed to salaried engineers leads to wider areas of responsible decision
making concerning safety.
THE CONSULTING ENGINEERS HAVE ETHICAL
RESPONSIBILITIES DIFFERENT FROM THE SALARIED
ENGINEERS, AS FOLLOWS:
• 1. ADVERTISING: The consulting engineers are directly responsible for
advertising their services, even if they employ other consultants to assist them.
But in many organisations, this responsibility is with the advertising executives
and the personnel department. They are allowed to advertise but to avoid
deceptive ones. Deceptive advertising such as the following are prohibited:
• (a) By white lies.
• (b) Half-truth, e.g., a product has actually been tested as prototype, but it was
claimed to have been already introduced in the market. An architect shows the
photograph of the completed building with flowering trees around but actually
the foundation of the building has been completed and there is no real garden.
• (c) Exaggerated claims: The consultant might have played a small role in a
well-known project. But they could claim to have played a major role.
• (d) Making false suggestions. The reduction in cost might have been achieved
along with the reduction in strength, but the strength details are hidden.
• (e) Through vague wordings or slogans.
• 2. Competitive Bidding: It means offering a price, and get something in return
for the service offered. The organizations have a pool of engineers. The
expertise can be shared and the bidding is made more realistic. But the
individual consultants have to develop creative designs and build their

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 43 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

reputation steadily and carefully, over a period of time. The clients will have to
choose between the reputed organizations and proven qualifications of the
company and the expertise of the consultants. Although competent, the younger
consultants are thus slightly at a disadvantage.
• 3. CONTINGENCY FEE:This is the fee or commission paid to the
consultant, when one is successful in saving the expenses for the client. A
sense of honesty and fairness is required in fixing this fee. The NSPE Code III
6 (a) says that the engineers shall not propose or accept a commission on a
contingent basis where their judgment may be compromised. The fee may be
either as an agreed amount or a fixed percentage of the savings realized. But in
the contingency fee-agreements, the judgment of the consultant may be biased.
The consultant may be tempted to specify inferior materials or design methods
to cut the construction cost. This fee may motivate the consultants to effect
saving in the costs to the clients, through reasonably moral and technological
means.
• 4. SAFETY AND CLIENT’S NEEDS:The greater freedom for the consulting
engineers in decision making on safety aspects, and difficulties concerning
truthfulness are the matters to be given attention. For example, in design-only
projects, the consulting engineers may design something and have no role in
the construction.

• Sometimes, difficulties may crop-up during construction due to non-
availability of suitable materials, some shortcuts in construction, and lack of

necessary and adequate supervision and inspection. Properly-trained
supervision is needed, but may not happen, unless it is provided. Further, the
contractor may not understand and/or be willing to modify the original design
to serve the clients best. A few on-site inspections by the consulting engineers
will expose the deficiency in execution and save the workers, the public, and
the environment that may be exposed to risk upon completion of the project.

The NSPE codes on the advertisement by consultants provide some
specific regulations. The following are the activities prohibited in
advertisement by consultant:
• 1. The use of statement containing misrepresentation or omission of a
necessary fact.
• 2. Statement intended or likely to create an unjustified expectation.
• 3. Statement containing prediction of future (probable) success.
• 4. Statement intended or likely to attract clients, by the use of slogans or
sensational language format.
Discuss: Engineers as Expert Witnesses (6)
Discuss about role of engineers as expert witness. (7)
ENGINEERS AS EXPERT WITNESSES

• Frequently engineers are required to act as consultants and provide expert
opinion and views in many legal cases of the past events. They are required to
explain the causes of accidents, malfunctions and other technological behavior
of structures, machines, and instruments, e.g., personal injury while using an
instrument, defective product, traffic accident, structure or building collapse,
and damage to the property, are some of the cases where testimonies are
needed. The focus is on the past.
The engineers, who act as expert-witnesses, are likely to abuse their
positions in the following manners:
• 1.HiredGuns:Mostly lawyers hire engineers to serve the interest of their
clients. Lawyers are permitted and required to project the case in a way
favorable to their clients. But the engineers have obligations to thoroughly
examine the events and demonstrate their professional integrity to testify only
the truth in the court. They do not serve the clients of the lawyers directly. The

hired guns forward white lies and distortions, as demanded by the lawyers.
They even withhold the information or shade the fact, to favor their clients.
• 2.MoneyBias:Consultants may be influenced or prejudiced for monitory
considerations, gain reputation and make a fortune.
• 3.EgoBias:The assumption that the own side is innocent and the other side is
guilty, is responsible for this behavior. An inordinate desire to serve one‘s
client and get name and fame is another reason for this bias.
• 4.SympathyBias:Sympathy for the victim on the opposite side may upset the
testimony. The integrity of the consultants will keep these biases away from the
justice. The court also must obtain the balanced view of both sides, by
examining the expert witnesses of lawyers on both sides, to remove a probable
bias.

DUTIES

• 1.The expert-witness is required to exhibit the responsibility of confidentiality
just as they do in the consulting roles. They cannot divulge the findings of the
investigation to the opposite side, unless it is required by the court of law.
• 2.More important is that as witness they are not required to volunteer evidence
favorable to the opponent. They must answer questions truthfully, need not
elaborate, and remain neutral until the details are asked for further.
• 3.They should be objective to discover the truth and communicate them
honestly.
• 4.The stand of the experts depends on the shared understanding created within
the society. The legal system should be respected and at the same time, they
should act in conformance with the professional standards as obtained from the
code of ethics.
• 5.The experts should earnestly be impartial in identifying and interpreting the
observed data, recorded data, and the industrial standards. They should not

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

distort the truth, even under pressure. Although they are hired by the lawyers,
they do not serve the lawyers or their clients. They serve the justice. Many a
time, their objective judgments will help the lawyer to put up the best defense
for their clients.
• 6.Where expert evidence refers photographs ,plans, calculations, analyses
,measurements ,survey reports or other similar documents ,these must be
provided to the opposite party at the same time as the exchange of reports.
ENGINEERS AS ADVISORS IN PLANNING AND POLICY MAKING
• Public planning and policy-making are the two significant aspects that
promote technological advancements and achievements in all countries.
Several segments of our communities such as economists, sociologists,
engineers and other professionals are involved in both public planning and
policy-making. Engineers are associated with both of these processes which
directly depend upon the inputs of public funds. The merits and demerits of any
project such as transport, housing land reforms and energy sector, are to be
actively considered as the basic part of policy-making. In contrast, planning
requires technical information from qualified technologists about the risks and
advantages of a specific project.The engineers are required to give their view
on the future such as in planning, policy-making, which involves the
technology. For example, should India expand nuclear power options or
support traditional energy sources such as fossil fuels or alternative forms like
solar and wind energy? In the recent past, this topic has created lot of
fireworks, in the national media.
• Generally engineers with high experience and expertise act as advisors .An
engineer has freedom to accept an offer to provide advice on a project in which
he alone cannot asses the project wholly because the project has some areas out
of his knowledge .In such cases the advisor should engage another qualified
person to assess that part of the project and his contribution should be limited
to his expertise.

Page 47 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

Various issues and requirements for engineers who act as advisors are:
• 1.Objectivity: The engineers should study the cost and benefits of all possible
alternative means in objective manner, within the specified conditions and
assumptions.
• 2.Study All Aspects: They have to study the economic viability (effectiveness),
technical feasibility (efficiency), operational feasibility (skills) and social
acceptability, which include environmental and ethical aspects, before
formulating the policy.
• 3.Values:Engineers have to posses the qualities, such as (a) honesty, (b)
competence (skills and expertise), (c) diligence (careful and alert) (d) loyalty in
serving the interests of the clients and maintaining confidentiality, and (e)
public trust, and respect for the common good, rather than serving only the
interests of the clients or the political interests.
• 4.Technical Complexity: The arbitrary, unrealistic, and controversial
assumptions made during the future planning that are overlooked or not
verified, will lead to moral complexity. The study on future is full of
uncertainties than the investigations on the past events. On the study of energy
options, for example, assumptions on population increase, life style,
urbanization, availability of local fossil resources, projected costs of generating
alternative forms of energy, world political scenario, world military tensions
and pressures from world organizations such as World Trade Organization
(W.T.O.) and European Union (EU) may increase the complexity in judgment
on future.
• 5.NationalSecurity: The proposed options should be aimed to strengthen the
economy and security of the nation, besides safeguarding the natural resources
and the environment from exploitation and degradation.

Explain the various played by engineers who work as
advisors? (7)
1. HiredGuns: This model highlights the client‘s wishes and acts accordingly.
All the other factors are given less priority. Assumptions about uncertainties
are inclined in a direction favorable to the client‘s case.
• 2.Value-Neutral Analysts:This model expresses the idea of being neutral and
the avoidance of any form of advocacy towards anyone. The cost-benefit
analyses if made, are to be done according to the value criteria, explicitly.
• 3.Value-Guided Advocates:This model advocates the idea that it is the
responsibility of engineers to keep the public good in mind and maintain
honesty about both technical facts and the values that guide their studies.
Define moral leadership. (3)
Justify the need for moral leadership in today’s business
environment. (3)

MORAL LEADERSHIP

 Engineers provide many types of leadership in the development and
implementation of technology, as managers, entrepreneurs, consultants,
academics and officials of the government. Moral leadership is not merely the
dominance by a group. It means adopting reasonable means to motivate the
groups to achieve morally desirable goals. This leadership presents the
engineers with many challenges to their moral principles. It has been an
interesting discussion that engineers take up several types of leadership similar
to other professionals such as corporate consultants, academicians and
government officials. Engineers are best suited to be 'efficient moral leaders'
to set an exemplary models both in their technical professions and community
societies.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

 Engineers, within their communities and professions contribute to
technological process, as managers, business entrepreneurs, corporate
consultants, academics and government officials they provide many forms of
leadership in developing and implementing technology. Leadership can be
understood as success in moving a group collectively, towards goals.Moral
leaders, are the individuals who direct, motivate, organize, creatively manage,
or in other ways move groups towards morally valuable goals. Leaders might
be in position of authority within a corporation, or they might not be.
Leadership can be shown by individuals participating at all levels of
organizations.

MORALLY CREATIVE LEADERS

• Moral leaders are morally creative. This does not mean that they discover or
improvise new moral values from scratch. Moral values are the product of
centuries and millennia of gradual development, not instantaneous invention.
Moral creativity consists in identifying the most important values that apply in
a particular situation, bringing them into focus through effective
communication within groups and forming workable commitments to
implement them.Moral creativity is achieving success through new ways of
thinking with standard moral values. This is achieved by identifying new
possibilities for applying, extending and putting values into practice rather than
inventing new values for temporary comforts. But, this requires fresh moral
insights with deeper commitments grounded in integrity.

PARTICIPATION IN PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES

• Professional Societies do more than just promoting continuing education for
their members. They also serve to unify a profession, and to speak and act on
behalf of it. Professional societies provide a forum for communicating,
organizing and mobilizing change within and by large groups, which has a
moral dimension. After few incidents, many of the tensions existed in

Downloaded from Ktunotes.in

Page 50 of 57

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

professional societies are because of the uncertainties about their involvement
in moral issues.
• Effective professional activity whether in Engineering or any other profession,
requires a substantial degree of trust from clients and the public. Total absence
of such trust would undermine the possibility of making contracts, engaging in
cooperative work, exercising professional autonomy free of excessive
regulation and working under humane conditions. Building and sustaining that
trust is an important responsibility shared by all engineers. It is also an area
where moral leadership within professional societies is really important.

LEADERSHIP IN COMMUNITIES

• In communities and groups, the issues that bother and that are important should
be informed to everyone. But the stronger obligations arise for those who by
professional background are well grounded in specific issues as well as for
those who have time to train themselves as Public advocates. It shows that
there is certainly a need for moral leadership in identifying and expanding the
areas of possible good that can be achieved.

IDEALS OF VOLUNTARY SERVICE

• The need for moral leadership in Engineering, emphasizes the need for
involvement in professional societies and in community service. The leadership
should have substantial involvement in professional societies which, in addition
to furthering technical knowledge and representing engineers collectively, help
in establishing high standards of moral integrity within the profession. The
moral leadership should also have some involvement in community service.
Moral leadership does not consist of moral elitism and dominance, but instead
moral creativity in helping to guide, organize and stimulate groups toward
morally desirable goals.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES

Moral leadership is essentially required for the Engineers, for the reasons
listed as follows:
• 1. It is leading a group of people towards the achievement of global and
objectives. The goals as well as the means are to be moral. For example, Hitler
and Stalin were leaders, but only in an instrumental sense and certainly not on
moral sense.
• 2. The leadership shall direct and motivate the group to move through morally
desirable ways.
• 3. They lead by thinking ahead in time, and morally creative towards new
applications, extension and putting values into practice.  ̳Morally creative‘
means the identification of the most important values as applicable to the
situation, bringing clarity within the groups through proper communication,
and putting those values into practice.

• 4. They sustain professional interest, among social diversity and cross-
disciplinary complexity. They contribute to the professional societies, their

professions, and to their communities. The moral leadership in engineering is
manifested in leadership within the professional societies. The professional
societies provide a forum for communication, and canvassing for change within
and by groups.
• 5. Voluntarism: Another important avenue for providing moral leadership
within communities, by the engineers is to promote services without fee or at
reduced fees (pro bono) to the needy groups. The professional societies can
also promote such activities among the engineers. This type of voluntarism (or
philanthropy) has been in practice in the fields of medicine, law and education.
But many of the engineers are not self-employed as in the case of physicians
and lawyers. The business institutions are encouraged to contribute a
percentage of their services as free or at concessional rates for charitable
purposes.

• 6. Community service: This is another platform for the engineers to exhibit
their moral leadership. The engineers can help in guiding, organising, and
stimulating the community towards morally- and environmentally-desirable
goals. The corporate organizations have come forward to adopt villages and
execute many social welfare schemes, towards this objective.
Examine the importance of engineers as moral leaders. (7)
ROLE OF ENGINEERS AS MORAL LEADERS
• 1.They work for more goals: Engineers are applying their specialized
knowledge and skills to improve the technologies with a purpose of improving
the wellbeing of the people and society ,a morally motivated goal.
• 2.They choose morally desirable ways:Engineers lead the team members by
providing support and guidance in a creative manner and motivate them in their
job in morally desirable ways, adhering the ethical standards.
• 3.They add to moral creativity:Moral creativity refers to achieving success
through new ways of thinking with moral standards. Moral creativity consists
of identifying the most important values, bringing them into focus through
effective communication and bring clarity among the group members and
finally putting those values into practice.
• 4.Add to Professional Trust: Moral leadership of engineers within the
professional groups can bring trust towards their profession and professional
groups. Effective professional activity requires a good level of trust from the
clients and the public. Engineers as moral leaders can build and sustain a good
level of trust among the clients.
• 5. Philanthrophy and Community Development: Engineers as moral leaders
can contribute at large in voluntarily to develop the weaker sections of
population in areas like housing, sanitation, infrastructure development and
provide drinking water.They can also support communities in making
awareness about environment,pollution, bio diversity and such issues that

voluntary organisations are adopting villages for improving the basic needs of
rural people as a part of their social responsibility.
SAMPLE CODE OF CONDUCT

Name any three professional societies and their role relevant
to engineers. (3)
• The professional societies for engineers have formulated few codes of ethics
which are expected to be followed by an engineer of the particular discipline.
Following are a few societies that look into the discipline in Engineering −
• NSPE − National Society of Professional Engineers
• IEEE − The Institute of Electrical and Electronics engineering
• AIChE− American Institute of Chemical Engineers
• ASCE − American Society of Civil Engineers
• ASME − American Society of Mechanical Engineers
• ACM/IEEE/CS − Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and
Professional Practices.

• All these societies have proposed different codes of ethics expecting adherence
from the Engineers, to the highest standard of ethical conduct. This not only
helps the societies but also the Engineers.The NSPE (National Society of
Professional Engineers) has formulated codes as engineering has a direct and
vital impact on the quality of life for all the people. Accordingly, the services
provided by engineers require honesty, impartiality, fairness and equity and
must be dedicated to the protection of the public health, safety and welfare.
The fundamental things to be kept in mind, while engineers fulfill their
professional duties are the following −
• Hold paramount the safety, health and welfare of the public.

MODULE:5 GLOBAL ETHICAL ISSUES
• Perform services only in area of their competence.
• Issue public statements only in an objective and truthful manner.
• Act for each employer or client as faithful agents or trustees.
• Avoid deceptive acts.
• Conduct themselves honorably, responsibly, ethically and lawfully so as to
enhance the honor, reputation and usefulness of the profession.
All the other societies have proposed the code of ethics to be followed in their
respective disciplines, by the engineers. The professional ethics should be
accompanied by moral concerns, in acting responsibly towards the profession
while being in ethical limits.
The Codes of Ethics promote and sustain the ethical environment and
assist in achieving the ethical goals in the following manner:
• It creates an environment in a profession, where ethical behavior is the basic
criterion.
• It guides and reminds the person as to how to act, in any given situation.
• It provides support to the individual, who is being pressurized or tortured by a
superior or employer, to behave unethically.
• Apart from professional societies, companies and universities have framed their
own codes of ethics, based on the individual circumstances and specific
mission of the organizations.
